[{"video_id": "n2j4r5G-OYk", "transcript": "the company that we talked about where we said oh we met this girl she was a college student at NYU they got they did that Clubhouse thing where they did shoot your shot and I met her and I was like wow you're a star I don't know what this idea is she was doing like some web 3 version of The Bachelor I was like oh that's a terrible idea but this is hey that's okay this is your terrible idea you're gonna do amazing things I think they might have already pivoted into something kind of amazing or found something amazing under their umbrella and it's these shows so the watch one has in in four weeks 14 million views 2 million likes and a total budget of I think two thousand dollars 100 190 000 followers foreign we're live brother it's been dry for me not a lot of research and ideas going on are you the same dry season it's dry season yeah I um I know what you mean but um I can't say I relate because your boy's wet really you have stuff Andre's dripping with Concepts you know actually I have all the stuff prepared and then like typically in the four hours before we record I just come up with a whole different set of things that I want to talk about the first one is okay so I don't know the full back story of this but I I do think it's kind of cool so I saw a tweet that basically said there's like five 21 year olds who are building you know some Next Generation Media company uh okay what are you guys doing well basically it took him one month and they launched a series of original Tick Tock shows so not just like themselves on Tick Tock but an actual show so there's one show called buying time it's where they buy and sell watches like kind of like on the Fly um and you get to see them like buy or sell negotiate the watch what's the name of the company so the name of the company what is their name um I thought it was related to that mad realities thing it might be it's gonna say it sounds like that I think it is related to them I'll I'll try to try to go find it yeah it is it's either produced by them it's theirs or they're like in the network I'm not sure but they're in in their bio for all the shows it's at mad realities right so that the brand that we the the company that we talked about where we said oh we met this girl she was a college student at NYU they got they did that Clubhouse thing where they did shoot your shot and I met her and I was like wow you're a star I don't know what this idea is she was doing like some web 3 version of The Bachelor I was like oh that's a terrible idea but this is hey that's okay this is your terrible idea you're gonna do amazing things I think they might have already pivoted into something kind of amazing or found something amazing under their umbrella and it's these shows so the watch one has in in four weeks 14 million views two million likes and a total budget of I think two thousand dollars 190 000 followers and what are they doing on the show and does that two by the way some of these numbers might be a little off we we got we got Brandon the researcher he's running on the hamster wheel in the back here he's trying to get all the data but sometimes I mess up kind of reading his data so so numbers are directional for anything I ever say okay um but I did watch this other one keep the meter running so keep reader running's cool you'll like this concept they get in a cab in New York and the guy's like all right where are you trying to go and he's like uh where do you like to go in New York why don't you take me there I've seen this it's so good he's like take me to your favorite favorite place you know let's go eat uh you want lunch have you eaten today and the guy's like no I I don't need to end of my shift he's like let's go take me to your favorite spot he's like okay he's again just keep the meter running and they basically drive to like you know the little the like Halal Town part of New York to get out and you hear this story he's like he's like leave the meter running they go inside they eat he asks them about his kids and his life and how he ended up with a taxi does he like it and they're just enjoying a meal and they just do that the whole day uh also 2.4 million likes 160 000 followers budget it's really really great man that's a really great have you seen it I've seen it it's like um if humans of New York was a tick tock show and um and so they definitely find some gems of like human beings and you're just like by the end of it you're just like I just love this dude I just want this like taxi driver to have an easier life and it's a great show she's happy too which is the best part it's not it doesn't make you feel guilty because they're sad they're very happy and content with a simple life and most of the people who are watching Tick Tock have like 10 times more going for them than this guy and are 10 times less happy and you know discontent of scrolling Tick Tock basically at the time so it's like one of those things that makes you feel good it's a feel-good show then they have this other one called Einstein Elementary it's basically this guy he calls himself the Einstein of Wall Street it kind of looks like Einstein got gray hair puffing out to the side and he just explains stock market [ __ ] in like simple terms and this one has a million likes and a hundred thousand followers and I'm just like this is really really cool they are basically prototyping these shows that could be produced into real shows or this might be it um and the reason I wanted to bring this up is because a 21 year olds doing cool [ __ ] love it B if you think about like what's the next Generation like you know you worked on that show or worked with a guy from American Pickers or like there's all these like random Niche shows right it's like yeah these guys they go into [ __ ] storage units and they like you know they have to cook a meal out of what's in there yeah who the [ __ ] out of this why am I watching this for two two and a half hours um those shows are going to happen on tick tock not TV and they're gonna happen like a thousand fold you're gonna get a thousand times more experiments just using Tick Tock the second thing is I have this framework that I learned from it by Buddy Sully which was the doors versus Windows so when I saw this I was like huh they got like you know millions of views but they kind of don't make any money and it kind of goes away so I don't really see the opportunity and at first I kind of wrote it off like yeah that's the problem with Tick Tock man you can get you can pop off but like then what so what and I think that's so what drives away a lot of people but there's another part of me that's like of course this is valuable of course if you created a show that people like and millions of people watch it there's going to be value there on this platform that's growing and taking over like the entire social media it's like the fastest growing company in the world uh of course you being one of the fastest growing channels on the fastest growing up you know media app is a is a very valuable thing it's just not clear exactly what that value is how you'll capture it and in a few years it'll be like wow this person makes a hundred million dollars off Tick Tock that's crazy right the same way we say about Mr Beast on YouTube and people on Twitch oh ninja makes how many millions of dollars on Twitch that's crazy just for playing video games and to me this is a Windows versus doors thing when the analogy goes like this most people only want to work for window on window opportunities window opportunities where you could see straight through you can see what's the value on the other side and you see what's inside then you can open up open the window or break the window whatever hop in and take the value what a door opportunity is like a door is opaque you can't see what's on the other side you know there's probably something but you don't see exactly what it is and it's good to go for window opportunities because you can see exactly what's there but it is bad to be the type of person who only will do things and only take massive effort on window opportunities and you never go knock on doors and when you knock on doors it's because uh 90 of other people have just walked by because they don't know what's inside they don't they don't want to make the effort and I think this is a doors opportunity where people on Tick Tock are going to get way bigger than most people realize they're going to figure out how to make money even in these like 15 seconds of Fame moments that they're having and huge brands are going to be built this way and I just think it's a door opportunity we haven't we haven't heard the five success stories you need to hear before it becomes a gold rush and everybody starts to copy it that's true I think though in some regard you uh like I work in media industry so do you like it's a pretty like tried and true method of like getting an audience and making money through advertising so I have faith that they'll figure it out the thing that a lot of these companies where they screw up there's basically I've been thinking a lot about this but there's like one or two mistakes that you can make and well I mean I've thought of one or two mistakes that you can make in business that are like basically irreversible so most decisions are reversible not all but most and a few that are not is if you screw up your cap table and you raise too much money and you have a company like BuzzFeed that makes like 350 million in Revenue maybe like 50 million in Prof profit I think their market cap is a hundred and fifty million right now because uh like they're like I don't know how they're gonna you know I don't know how the markets work like this but they're never gonna like live up to the hype that they once had of like 5 billion or whatever it is same with uh like bird scooter bird scooter maybe not a horrible company did you see what their market cap is today it's like 70 million or something right what is it no 40. 40 million dollars wow 40 million dollars and so a company like this like this house is worth more than bird isn't that crazy the founder the founder owns house the founder bought a 20 million dollar house isn't that nuts like the hustle was basically almost worth more than bird and bird Soul or raised I think like a billion dollars right to be fair the hustle was way cooler than bird I mean hey dude scooters littered all over the city like I [ __ ] with that you know I I like riding a scooter oh nice we got your socks on but the the point being with this with this person's business they could I think they could kill it as long as they don't raise too much money because if they do then I think that they're gonna they're gonna die and it's gonna be horrible did I ever tell you the story about Elizabeth Murdoch calling me no what was it so the week the hustle launched I wrote this blog post saying that we launched and I get a call a cough and it was this Australian lady she goes hi this is Elizabeth Murdock and I knew right away who that was but I was like wait like Rupert's daughter like the owner of Fox Liz yeah I was like Liz what's what's up what are you doing Colleen she goes hey I saw your blog post and I think what you're doing is really cool I uh I think she said either she's launching or she already launched this company called uh I think it was called vertical networks and it was exactly this thing where she goes uh basically I negotiated a deal with Snapchat and uh they asked me to make content for them so I'm funding people to make content and you seem kind of like a loose canon who's pretty funny uh can I like I don't remember I don't want to put words in her mouth but she was like can I buy you or like fund you and you just make content for us on Snapchat and I was like huh that's interesting so I get in touch with like the guy running the company his name's Tom he's awesome and he was like Yeah so basically just like move here and just start making content all day for Snapchat and I was like I don't know man that seems like a lot of work I don't really want to do that I've got a girlfriend who I'm probably gonna get married to and he goes all right well no big deal we'll find someone else and so they find someone else and it's a uh these four guys or three guys and they started a YouTube channel and a snap or a Snapchat Channel and then a YouTube channel and it's called yes Theory have you heard of yes Theory oh no way that's that came from that yeah isn't that crazy so yes theory is this it's like three guys and their whole idea is like they do crazy [ __ ] where they like and these guys are like they're they're my age but at the time when they started they were like 25 and 26 so like these young like good looking dudes and they would meet someone on the streets of Venice this like cute girl and be like hey do you want to go to Rome right now or they would get they would get in an Uber and they're like hey Uber driver um do you want to go to Hawaii this second we'll go and just leave your car then we'll just pay for everything and they do these crazy things like this and it's this great show and it started this way as as one of these Snapchat shows and so what these young women are doing with this like with this Media Company it's the same thing that like has worked before in the past yeah that's that's really cool I didn't know uh I didn't know you did that wow you were so close to a whole different life I don't regret it man those guys like have if you follow their story dude they get burnt out like because they would do this crazy stuff at first it was like let's go skydiving or let's make a bucket list and do it and then it was like let's go to the most remote place on Earth for 24 hours and then let's go live on an island with people who have never seen white people why is it that you always hear about YouTubers getting burnt out but you never hear podcasters really getting burnt out because we don't do [ __ ] we just sit here and talk like we don't have to do anything like dude my friend Noah Kagan has this YouTube channel where he has to go and like among many things he like knocks on doors and asks people how they got rich dude I don't even if I don't see Corn Flakes at the grocery store I don't buy it I'm too embarrassed to ask the clerk at the counter where they are like if it's not on Amazon or easily available at a corner store I don't buy it like I can't imagine knocking on a door and asking them how they got rich it's hard it's exhausting especially like Noah's cool he's he's a friend of ours but isn't it kind of like no you're above this like you're Noah you're rich we should be knocking on your door and asking you how you got rich this is the point of being rich that you don't have to do this [ __ ] yeah but he's you know broke boys he's trying to play the game he's trying to get popular I don't know he's just trying to get popular and so it's working and he actually has this new series where he interviews old people and who are rich and asks him if it was worth it and that's actually a very very cool series that one that one's cooler it's also more like a podcast it's yes but yeah dude youtubing is just it seems too hard of a job so anyway yeah I'm about what these young women are doing but uh before you move are you ready to move on to the next one yeah let's go to something else wait but before you do I have to I want to say something to our listeners I'm gonna say this every episode now until we hit like 500 000 subscribers I want to present a a gentleman's agreement do you know what a gentleman's agreement is Sean I was born under a gentleman's agreement I could a gentleman's agreement I don't know what that means actually I actually don't know what it means it's a non-papered contracted agreement so people tell us all the time that they get addicted and they get obsessed with this podcast that is awesome and so it doesn't matter if you're on YouTube if you're on Spotify or you're on iTunes whatever you're using right now if this is our your the first episode you're listening to you get this one for free but if it's the second episode or more that you've listened to here's our Gentleman's Agreement you go to your YouTube app or whatever you're on and you click subscribe or follow or whatever it is and you do that for us we make this for you we're your like little research laboratory rats we're doing all this crap for you just go and do that for us because the more you do that the more views we're gonna get the more hyped we get the more dopamine we get and the harder we work so that's our gentleman's agreement if this is your second plus episode just go and do that for us right now that's that's my gentleman's agreement and and the goal is you said 500 1000 what YouTube subscribers I think we should just say 500 I think we should just say 500 000 YouTube subscribers we've gone from 20 000 to 150 000 in the last year 150 to 500 this year 2023. all right down 500 also where's our plaque I don't know dude I want the platform like where is the plaque oh you know we've been talking about participation trophies like it's a bad thing I want it I want that yeah yeah you say 80 of success is just showing up what I showed up where's my plan yeah we were supposed to get a flag at a hundred thousand you got sent to the HubSpot headquarters somewhere darmesh is sitting there polishing our plaque showing it off at his parties like it's his where is the plaque I need to know there's a conspiracy and I need to know and I told I told the people on Twitter because I said hey who should keep the plaque me Sam how are we gonna do this we're remote it's only one plaque they said they'll give you a bunch of them and then people said small boy stuff you're worrying about a hundred thousand dollar a hundred thousand subscriber plaque and I said you know what you're right we're gonna take the plaque we're gonna take it to a field and we're gonna destroy it because it's totally small boy plaque we're not we're not celebrating until we're at a million um but we need the plaque to destroy it office based style like that is the yeah I have no problem destroying your plaque yeah you frame yours my point is this is our gentleman's agreement and I'm gonna I'm gonna bring up our agreement every single time we do a pod so that's it that's all I gotta say we can go to the next segment I do think you totally misused gentleman agreement but whatever it's uh that's the best okay what um you had a thing about uh coffee Zilla and also can we talk two after things happened after our previous episodes number one Tim Ferriss tweeted out our podcast cool moment Tim first maybe what was one of the first podcasts I ever listened to love that guy he listened to our section where we're talking about him and my experience meeting him and all that your experience meeting him and he said first he emailed me just goes hey heard heard the Pod loved it it was so funny Sam was talking about how OCD I am about editing things he goes normally I am but you edited a great thumbs up don't worry about it and I was like okay good uh and then by the way I hope I was I hope he didn't take that as disrespect it was supposed to be a compliment yeah an admirable thing Tim ignore the words we say we're sucking up to you all right whatever we say we might make some footfalls on that but we just badly want to be your friend all right that's just all that's that's all that you need to take away from any of this um all right second thing we did this episode with Billy McFarland the guy from fire festival and I think you like hit him up and hung out with him afterwards is this true yeah he on the Pod or either like before after I forget I told him where I'm basically visiting family right now and he said oh yeah I'm right down the street from you and so I texted him and I just said thanks for coming on yeah like I'm we're I'm down the street from you and and he said great you want to go hang out right now I go yeah sure let's just go we'll go get some ice cream what'd you guys do we went and got we got tea because it was past 3 P.M and I didn't want to drink coffee by the way so I got that is the move don't do coffees anymore ice cream just take people out to ice cream it's an amazing move they want to lick a thing in front of them I think that's weird right you gotta get the spoon yeah and so we went and hung out and we talked about like I I can't talk about it all but we talked about like his family I just wanted to ask him I was like tell me about how you were raised like tell me about your family so I won't mention that stuff but we talked about family stuff uh and then we talked about like uh prison stories um which she like mentioned on the Pod a little bit and then I basically told him what I said here which was this idea that you had on the pod that's really stupid man I bet you you could charge startups twenty thousand dollars a month and be like a consultant just do that and he goes yeah let's talk about that and so we talked about that about like what we would do if if we were in his situation and what I think he should do and uh I talked about um the mistakes he made and like why did you why what were you thinking and he basically expanded on what we talked about in the Pod which was like I just didn't want to look stupid and I lied and I was embarrassed and I just got into this you know I just did something bad but uh yeah hung out with them and here's my takeaway I understand why people believed him very believable very Charming um like every time he did take you to ice cream after all dude yeah like I got whined and done and I could honestly see myself becoming friends with him but at the same time I'm like are you doing it again uh so you know and that's what I told him I was like it's hard I think he was I think he was entertaining enough and I think he seemed fun like why not be friends with them and hey even if he does it again it's as my [ __ ] up friend man everybody's got a [ __ ] up friend who just keeps [ __ ] up he might be yours it's okay if that's the worst case scenario let's say he's the worst case scenario he kind of you know steps in in poo poo again makes makes the bad decision let's say that's the worst case scenario that's all right no no no sweat I feel like you're a little scared to just be friends with this guy just be friends with him dude our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better I'll be friends with them I won't do any business with them for a long time until like we've you know he's proven to hang out with them in public together Are you ashamed I already did I already did no I hung out with them in public no and if someone if I was if I was with him and someone said something mean to him I would be like dude you gotta don't do that right now please let's say that about my friend Billy yeah don't say about my friend Billy because here's the deal that's what I'm talking about dude he served his time so uh I've like a volunteered I'm a saint by the way I volunteered at prisons before so like I'm a real Saint uh I've like worked with these types of people before everyone gets gets a second chance and man five years or how much did he serve four years that's a long [ __ ] time that is a long time that is college except like you don't leave your dorm room ever you know like it's the worst and uh you know I think he paid the price so I it was really exciting to to kind of hang out with him what did you think about the Pod with them yeah I thought it was good uh I thought he was you know likable and I thought he was interesting and I all the same things you thought I thought he was like about that he's interesting uh you know I thought he's you know owned up to what he did and he didn't try to deny it or deflect it or give some BS excuses he was just like yeah I messed up I did it and I think that most people who lie don't lie because they're evil they lie because they're insecure and they lie because they're afraid I know this because anytime I lie is because I'm insecure or afraid and um and so you know I don't really like I think that's a completely understandable thing and I think he did it at a scale which was bad obviously that affected people that was bad uh but also you know put it into perspective you know like what did he do he lied to professional investors who you know in their diligence didn't uncover it they're fine you know no harm done for them there were some people that went to this uh Festival that got disappointed that's you know unfortunate but you know okay but it was a bad really bad party and then I think the worst thing was like the locals of the island I think were sort of left holding the bag in some way I don't know the full details of that but I would say that's probably the most kind of harm done from it and I don't think that was his intention at all right I think his intention was to try to pull this thing off and he he uh tried to fake it till you make it and he faked it and didn't make it and like this is what happens when you fake it didn't make it right so like I think that he rightfully got convicted I think he served his time and I don't hold that against him uh go forward I was just giving you a hard time because I feel like you like the guy but you're trying to like slightly tiptoe a bit around it and I think you're honestly and he's fine and you know like let's let's move on with life and see what he does from here that is my honest feeling I like him and I'm eager to see what he does but I'm still like I'm still arms like but here's here's what the fascinating thing that I hung out with him I call it like the resistance so I've said this before the world wants us to be vanilla they want us to put put us in his box and people who residated where are you going with this people who resist that I'm fascinated by them even if they are truly a saint or if they're a criminal there is like this Allure this Fascination that I have with them no matter what and I think we all do we all like that you know people who are like this is why cult leaders are awesome you're like oh my God you're convincing me that there's like another way of living and and he has that same thing and there's levels to this is what I'm learning and his level of like he he kept telling me he was like I thought I could pull it off and in my head I'm like you're [ __ ] insane everything every little bit of of evidence points to you not being able to pull this off but there's something about you that you think that you could pull this off even when all the odds are against you and you're delusional you still believe it and there's something incredibly fascinating about this and it's so interesting that that he raised 25 million dollars for a festival when he was 25 years old and he was just like yeah this is what we're gonna do I only look forward he was I think he said on the potty goes I only look forward to like what's gonna happen uh and I like I was like that's fascinating to me because that is not what we are we're we're we're we're bullied into this box and anyone who resists that I think is interesting to me I think you are you've touched on something very very true I used to say this all the time I go I feel like the world is Baskin Robbins but all 31 flavors are vanilla and I was just because I was like I look around and it's all vanilla vanilla over here another vanilla Choice over there another vanilla Choice over there every's living these very vanilla lifestyles and I'm not going to pretend I'm some Renaissance Man adventurous but in my own way I feel like I fight the good fight against vanilla I try to choose to live my life in a way that makes sense to me even if it is non-standard um and that has and that is something like deep inside deep inside the core I feel that I feel that that's what I'm meant to do that's how I'm meant to live and I take great pride anytime I do something non-vanilla I try not to do it just for non-vanilla sake but actually sometimes I do that too just to push it right like sometimes I just go and I go eat the you know caramel ribbons or the the bubble gum flavor whatever I don't even like it the bubblegum flavor tastes tastes nasty but I'll just do it just to remember remind myself not to be totally vanilla and so I am with you on that and that brings me to something that you tweeted out that I wanted to talk about it's called The Adventurous this is a how sick is that you tweeted something out about this you go this did you say I don't know what you say this looks awesome I want to do it I go to the website immediately I'm like oh this requires leaving the house not gonna do it but let's just check out what other people are doing copywriting is so good the copywriting is right I'm just going to read it out loud because I think it is worthy of of a little oral speech here so we're The Adventurous this is what it says on the website we're fighting to make the world less boring our planet used to slap us about the face cheeks with iron fists of Adventure every day Maps had edges to walk off whole continents lay undiscovered but now the entire surface of the Earth has been scanned by satellites and shoveled into your mobile phone tagged with twattery about what restaurant serves the best mocha latte frappa [ __ ] we live to find ways to make the world a bit more difficult to bring chaos into our over sanitized lives to create Adventures where you don't know what will happen tomorrow or even if you'll make it because we think there's no greater moment than those seconds as you leap into an abyss of uncertainty and potential disaster okay so this is our art fellow artists out there you remember the episode where Sam declared that he's an artist has got to create [ __ ] this is this is really amazing copywriting I think this is like such a good example for the swipe file of a I like you know in my power writing course I'm gonna like use this as one of the examples of an US versus them uh us first them frame status quo breaker which says the status quo if they took something good which was that wow your mobile phone has you know like the full map and you can get directions you can find the best restaurants you can and they're like you coddled little baby you are you living this over sanitized life don't you remember what you were put on this Earth to do and how life used to be back in the good old days and I think that that Nostalgia the US versus them this is amazing copywriting are you gonna actually do one of their things yeah I messaged them and I and I said like uh I was like hey I'm gonna try and brag to you because I want to impress you but here's who I am and I like listed off a bunch of credentials I go I'm not asking for a discount also a great copy how do you how do you brag without how do you brag while nodding at like I know what I'm doing here I know why I'm doing this I just want to say this out loud likeable bro yeah I emailed them I go uh well I'm gonna list a bunch of accomplishments because I want you to know who I am I'm not exactly a somebody but I'm not exactly not a somebody uh here's what I've done and I and I listed it out and I go the reason I'm explaining this is I'm gonna pay full price I'm not asking for any type of discount or anything like that but like I want to do one of the America one and I want to baby like bring a bunch of friends and like tweet about it and things like that like when are you doing in America one because they don't basically what this company does is you pay nineteen hundred dollars or something like that it's pretty cheap and then they either give you a car or a motorcycle or maybe a bicycle for different races and they host these races like in Mongolia and they drop you off at Point a and then it's like you have three days to travel 300 miles to point B and they literally just say all right everyone bye we'll meet you at point B figure it out and like one of those things is like you have to drive a mini bike which is like a 50cc that which is a very small motorcycle it's basically what they wrote on Dumb and Dumber another one is uh like a car that is a rickshaw which is like a well you know what direction does yeah yeah and so like they do these crazy things and yeah they're amazing and Sean go to their FAQs for the event this is another like really good um a really good way to like explain how to do copywriting because they're FAQs they're discussing go to like click one of their random races and then go to like the FAQs they're discussing really serious topics in an incredibly conversational way so they'll say like they'll say like um we plan on doing this unless kobit ruins it then it just ruins it like they just like talk in a really here's an example I clicked Mongolia and it says the route uh the section one the route Mongolia is big really effing big and driving through it as any of you ex Mongol rallies know is brain squashingly awesome thousands of miles of endless Horizons mountains dirt roads Nomads blah blah so riding through it on a motorbike designed for children is simply resplendent I don't know what that means uh Mongolia calls to the soul like a flight [ __ ] and then it sort of explains what's going on and then go to like go to FAQs and you'll see like they're like you pay 1900 with that comes your little mini bike some of which are good some are bad but that's part of the excitement and then like like they uh and they just like explained this like what will I eat mutton noodles question mark whatever you bring with you buy on the route or are lucky to be offered lucky enough to be offered along the way period next question yes how good is that foreign yeah this is really cool who's behind this is this like uh just a guy I think it's just two guys like two friends like these like I I watch their videos they make launch videos for each one and just two guys uh it's really fascinating so I want to do one I don't want to travel to Mongolia because like by the time they have it maybe I'll have like a kid or something I don't know but like I would like to like like if they were like if I could go to Colorado or Canada or like Mexico I would do it we're more like a convenient adventurist yeah yeah so like all the wild in my backyard yeah so if they could do that uh speaking of like levels and like content have you seen coffee Zilla I've seen coffee Zilla yes can we talk about this yeah let's talk about it let me give you the background about this guy so his name's coffee Zilla he only has one point something million subscribers on YouTube so he's not huge huge yet but he's growing quickly and yeah small boy stuff he um and he uh basically his whole thing is he wants to uncover internet scams um not just internet but mostly internet so guys like um uh fellow podcast guests uh Tai Lopez like he'll do a whole thing with Ty Lopez or he'll do a whole thing on Andrew Tate or whole thing on Dan Lok who's like another internet guy which are like typical question that I often Google which is is X person legit exactly and he's trying to answer that question and usually he's going in saying they're not legit here's here's what we know so he's playing this with you know a bunch of people and now he's doing on Logan Paul Logan Paul had a thing called the crypto zoo I think it was called which was like this crypto project that had all this [ __ ] going on but the point being he has the most attention to detail [ __ ] I've ever seen like I I saw this on Casey neistat Casey neistat I'm like how are you making just your commute to work so fascinating it was like because he had all these interesting shots that were so thoughtful this guy has the same thing where there'll be like a robot sitting behind a bar and it's just like you know like oh I had a tough day at work coffee still is talking to like a fake robot and I'm like how is this interaction so freaking good or he'll like fly in people who worked with Logan Paul and he'll interview them in person and make this whole like 30 minute video that's as good as 60 minutes and it's so fascinating and it just shows you that there's levels to like the game and people who turn it up a notch I think they're rewarded yeah this guy uh his production quality has gotten like kind of insane um recently and I think that you know he's thriving on some of the big you know questions or controversies SBF uh Logan Paul who else does he do um Jake Paul I think he did uh what's his name uh entertain things and things like that uh yeah he's he's cool he's he's good and I I really like this Niche like I think he's carved out like a really strong Niche um and brand like visual brand too so I think he's done a kind of an amazing job with with his videos and his content but he kind of has pigeon told himself and there's this one move that a lot of people make the liver King made it when he said I do not take steroids and now this guy is he does the same thing where he says I do not make money through advertising through ads because I want you the reader or the viewer to be supporting me so I can make more genuine [ __ ] and I'm like no don't shut that off you may feel that way you may feel that way today but like Casey neistat has this funny thing where he was like dude I had 100 million views before I turned ads on my YouTube because I thought I was being like an artist and that was the stupidest thing ever because like I had I was so broke at the time and I couldn't like make more videos and had I done that I would have made an additional million dollars or whatever it is and that's how exactly how I feel I'd like to just take the money you could take the money and still be cool and ethical and by the way we could put like a before and after on the screen like if you go back into his channel three years ago it's literally him in a messy bedroom he's like holding a mic up with his hand and you know he literally looks different his background looks different and that's like you know how he started and this you can see the jump up and quality in three years is like pretty insane to be honest with you three years isn't that long dude it this podcast is three years old I think and like just like the other day you like didn't even wear a shirt when you recorded like like a potential Choice like we we still don't I don't even have a camera that works yet I mean like like this guy this guy basketball hoop behind me now so we're moving up like it took forever just to get a video camera that works and we still call it a video camera uh like yeah I asked how to get a camcorder uh yeah his per his progress is is wonderful yeah that's amazing um all right what else we got what other what other uh content you want to do I don't have anything okay wow the well the well-runath drive uh okay let me give you one um have you seen this website gently.com no I think this is kind of a cool idea basically it's you know like people you do this probably you probably buy like kind of vintage leather goods or whatever off of like I don't know whatever some like eBay or Poshmark or depop there's all these second hand marketplaces that that exist so I just named three or four of them uh the real real right there's like all these different places you could go what gently did was pretty smart was they just said all right how do we make a search engine so you just tell us what product you want we will go search all the different places and then we will just send you text message alerts as we find good deals on that thing here and that brand or that item that you want I think this is pretty smart and then they cut a deal with all the different Marketplace which is hey if we send you the customer we bought we get to bring the customer the buyer to you how do we get you know our 10 kit cut or whatever it is off of that purchase I think this is anytime you have like a fragmented set of places where something is the One-Stop search for it and search and look they did smart there's like these alerts so uh as soon as you put in that you're interested in something they'll just constantly alert you about this thing it's sort of like this like highly targeted you know ad that they're sending you each time and then you can go and you can buy the thing and I think this is pretty cool saves the customer a bunch of time brings these marketplaces customers and um and does it in a way that's like actually like pretty seamless I thought this is actually a pretty cool idea I'm gonna sign up for this uh you are right you stereotype to me correctly you made some pulled you you made a stereotype and uh you're 100 correct uh I was looking at investing in it and I was like all right let me just try using this thing and I was like oh I don't have like Hobbies or tastes like you know there's not a I don't know any of these Brands I don't buy any vintage Goods or like you know exclusive designer things and so didn't really know what to do well it looks like it's you're trying it looks like if it's good well it looks like it's for women mostly um because it's Poshmark that's mostly women I think only women or mostly women the real real Mostly women I actually just went to the real real yesterday they have a story where I'm staying uh it's mostly women I I believe but no I I like this I don't know if this could be a big business wouldn't the margins be like nothing yeah because you're taking a cut of a cut so I think that's the the hard part you have to have like really high volume um but I do think there's an it's a it's enough of an interesting wedge where like they'll probably need a second Miracle meaning if they'd have to the first miracle is getting this popular where people start using this all the time and then the second Miracle is going to be something like you know they they create their own you know Supply on the on the marketplace or they create their own Marketplace out of this or they got to do something maybe it's a subscription I don't know they'd have to come up with some other thing that's going to um gonna make this work so so I do think that that's the that's the second thing all right let me give you an idea now um you've used click funnels correct yeah I have I've made a lot of money using click funnels if I ask you what is Click funnels great at why would anybody use click funnels quickly spin Up drag and drop landing pages that can also accept money and the landing page well there's a bunch of landing page builders that are drag and drop why click funnels is it better design is it you know faster easier to use what is the benefit it's mostly horribly designed uh it looks like it was designed with like a set of crayons and the reason it's like a perfect way to say it yeah it looks like someone like just got like a red and blue crayon and like whiteboard it they just like turn that into a website uh so no uh it does it just has a three or four features that are exactly what you need for getting money quickly on a website and I think you know one of them the way I would describe it is called click funnels for a reason which is that they are they're specifically funnels so they're like designed to convert a customer um through a funnel which the funnel might happen it might be like first we're going to grab their email we're gonna optimize for grab email then once they grab the email we're gonna then offer them this upsell and we're gonna then ask them to pay and if they don't pay then then they'll go here the whole point of their software is to get your money to become my money and that's like what they do they go you have someone on your website how do you get the money in their Bank their bank account into yours and they make it easy so you think I'm like perfect you can exam you accept an email you get the sale you do it upside out you do all this stuff and they're unabashed they they're unashamed whereas upsell it'll be like upsell one then if they say yes hit them with upsell two if they say yes hit them with upsell three if they say no hit them with down sell down sell one down cell two down it's like what the hell are they I literally don't even have enough products to like fill your funnel I don't have down sell products what are these um but it works it works it was quite it works and I think clickfunnels does over 100 million in revenue or something like that they throw that 100 million number around a lot I think it's way more than a time or an annual thing I think they're churn is really high that's that's the problem with these things is like the churn like that attitude of like make your bank account my bank account that all doesn't exactly have the most like the best longevity but yeah your customers are kind of piece of [ __ ] marketers you're like bullying them yeah I think so I think somebody can make a click funnels 2.0 um in fact I think we could make click funnels 2.0 uh like I think if we used our brand we could create a better click funnels which is what the guy did Russell Brunson he had a uh he was like a Content guy I mean he he like had masterminds and [ __ ] like that but he had like a huge email list and then he like launched the software and it wasn't great at first in fact it's still not really that great if there are any developers or designers that don't use crayons um you know build us a click funnels competitor We Will We Will promote it because Cleveland is honestly a very useful tool it is super useful good at doing the job which is the your money to my money thing which is exactly what a lot of people want and it's simple and that's the beauty of it when you make a click funnels page it's like there's no navigation there's no footer there's no scroll it's like yeah it's a giant box that says give me your [ __ ] email and it says it's like a flashing button and it says if you click this thing with your email something good is gonna happen and like they'll might be something good I guess I'll put my email in and for some reason I don't know why this is still a thing when you sell a product there all of the product images are like pictures of DVD and PC game boxes do you know what I mean it's a box set always it's like a CD dude like I don't even own a thing that could accept a CD why is like this this like product always like a set of CDs yeah looks like this because it's infomercial right it's the equivalent of an infomercial but online um so I think some somebody click funnels I also think specifically for e-commerce there's not really a click funnels for e-commerce there's a bunch of people who think they're you click funnels for e-commerce and trust me I am in e-commerce I have tried to build funnels using Shogun Builder all of these guys nobody's done it nobody has made it simple nobody has made it stupidly obvious where you hit the customer over the head with the offer and like that's all you really need to do and I've looked at so many of these and nobody has nobody's made it dumb enough everybody makes it too smart and um and so I think there's there's generally like a click funnels like 2.0 and I think that there's click funnels for e-commerce is a is an opportunity that's out there and I think you would need like you'd either need to be a Russell Brunson type of guy where you are going to independently build your brand as a smart content entrepreneur marketer type dude or you should partner with uh or like you know we like someone like us who already has that audience and that brand can distribute a product like this and get it to I don't know probably somewhere between like three and six million AR just off of our audience um it's hard it's actually good but the product actually has to be good have you heard of uh well so another thing that click funnels did like these guys are really fascinating and at first I was a hater on them and then I was like oh no they're all right uh but they they they're what their conferences are are a little cringe but still cool like I respect it but they make money off info products and this was so fascinating and so smart so a lot of big software companies they're like dude I'm not gonna sell anything but the software because like this one thing makes so much profit and revenue like I'm just doing this one thing and they were like nah F that see we don't have a lot of money to spend so we're bootstrapped our marketing is going to be profitable and so they write like guides and do all this stuff and they'll charge like a hundred dollars for like a book and when you buy that book you're automatically like get a you know a month free of Click funnels and they basically when they hit 100 million in Revenue it was 80 million in subscription revenue and 20 million in info product revenue and they would create these info products and sell it and that's good because they would acquire a customer for a break-even amount for an info product and automatically add them into their subscription revenue for their software and that was really fascinating I thought it was a great idea and they've proven that it can work really nicely yeah I think in general uh Break Even marketing is a phrase I've used in every every single company I've built which is like what is a version of our marketing that itself is a not a cost center as a profit Center it doesn't have to be the main marketing channel but like we should do something like for you hustlecon was a good example of this right it's like yeah I'm gonna do hustlecon it's going to get people to find out about the hustle it's going to take people who like us and make them love us and make them super evangelists and it's going to get all these speakers to come speak that'll become content so that's marketing there but you were like yeah but this is not just like a money pit no we need to make money on our marketing and I just feel like most people don't really consider that but it like at twitchcon when I was at twitch it's the same thing twitch there's this thing called twitchcon it's this like I don't know 30 40 50 000 people something show up to this thing it's all did they make money off that and they they don't really try to make money off of it but the merch store at twitchcon literally the line is like it's like imagine like the San Diego Conference Center or whatever which is like a you know a three mile long building or some [ __ ] like that the line is the entire three miles it's like the craziest line you've ever seen people waiting slowly like hours to go in to buy your hoodie and I was like this is crazy how much are we making off this and like it was like you know run by this like two-person team it wasn't really like the main focus and like you know the event itself you know has sponsor stuff and they did have Revenue but like I felt like there could be so much more that was done there was so much more like potential to commercialize that thing and I get it which is like in your company of twitch's size you don't need to worry about making a couple million bucks off this thing but if you shrink that it kills me it still kills me yeah exactly exactly it's like well first of all you should have just been able to sell more merch just like by being more efficient like you know how many people didn't wait in this four hour line uh you know that that's just like one thing all together the second thing is um if you're not twitch you're not generating you know call it billion dollars of Revenue uh if you're click funnels or the hustle or you're a normal size business these these break-even marketing things a marketing event that makes you 500k or 1.5 million or something like that that's actually quite meaningful um compared to it losing 500k or losing a million dollars which is where most companies default to and I think just with a little bit of creativity you could turn a lot of cost centers into profit centers or at least Break Even when it comes to marketing dude there's this attitude that I've been having lately so I've been working on this like new project and I've switched my attitude when I was starting the hustle I was like um I'll do anything for any Advertiser to make any amount of money like whatever dude you know what I mean like I'm like whatever I just need I need pennies give me pennies I'll do it all and I'm like yeah sure like you know you know the rules said no CBD but like you know like what's I have an eraser we can erase that rule and uh now I've been like saying like nope this is what it is I say no to everything and like oh this person wants to join I don't really feel like it let's just raise the price really high so they don't want to join or like you know what I mean or like like let's like this this type of attitude it's made it's made the businesses so much more successful having that attitude and like it's it's pretty funny you know like there's this hot girl that I knew and I was like and she was like joking and she was like my motto for getting dudes is uh treat them mean keep them Keen the meaner I treat them the happier the more they want me and I was like that's the greatest thing ever I'm gonna do that with my life of course it didn't work with women but uh it's kind of worked with business this tree to mean keep them Keen it's like the more we say no the more they want it and I can't believe it's worked that way dude rhyming is just an underrated strategy in general let me just put that out there I don't know what the hell she's talking about but it rhymed and that made me feel good made me think that she's got her [ __ ] together dude treat them mean keep them Keen you lived in Australia Akin means like you know like you like them yeah you shouldn't need a dictionary for your catchphrases I I that's my personal opinion um right like you didn't know who Dolly Parton was though so like you don't really know anything [Laughter] all right um I got a bone to pick with the fitness industry so you're fit I'm aspiring to be fit yeah and a lot of the products I feel are geared towards people like you it's like bro you want to be ripped it's hey do you want you know girls do you want a bigger butt and flatter stomach you know that's kind of like me that's you and then that's the female version of you um I feel like 90 of like ad dollars go towards that when it comes to Fitness would you say that's true yeah just people who want to look good naked so you're struggling with your light bulb there by the way I know see there's this thing there's this compass that lets you show how to center it perfectly so that it uh floats but it's not not participating people are loving that thing by the way you're gonna sell a lot of them in the videos they're loving that light bulb yeah I know I'm not shouting out who made this because I'm gonna make our own this is this is the start of our merch store I've decided we need to do merch um we're two we're too [ __ ] catchy to not have merch bro we just gotta get the coin business um coins dollar bills whatever all right so so anyways Fitness okay 90 of dollars I feel like go towards getting you spring break ready but uh my trainer for example he works out he works me out in the garage and in doing so there's a whole bunch of people that pass by and I gotta say the most interested group of people that pass by are not looking to get ripped shredded jacked swole whatever words you want to say those aren't the words that they're interested in they want to be knee pain-free they want to be back pain free they want to be foot pain free and I feel like the pain-free uh version of exercise is a little under marketed and for every you know P90X or Beachbody program I think that there should be a even bigger version of that that's just helping Mom not have knee pain when she walks or gets up from her chair and um and I think that what happens is there's a lot of workout programs that would say we could do that that's what ours our program is great for that like we both like these over toes guy he's great for that but there's still this leap that the person has to put together that oh if I do these exercises then that will be the the benefit that I get out of it whereas somebody else might be trying to jump higher run faster and I think that in the same way that the uh you know that vitamin brand Ollie how they instead of saying we provide vitamin D uh or we we provide magnesium it's like it's like we better sleep better yeah yeah immunity sleep better you know whatever they basically just go straight to the benefit and I think that there should be a juggernaut of a fitness company that is simply trying to make it so that you are back pain and knee pain and foot pain free neck pain these are common pains that people who are you know know have a ton of money have a ton of motivation to get these things fixed and it's just a lightweight exercise program I've been telling you about this remember I was like my Instagram feed is just full of shirtless dudes like stretching their hips and like doing like stretches like it's just this whole they call it Mobility now Mobility is the new pain-free you know or Mobility is like the new yogabilities I think I think it's the right idea but I think it's the wrong frame I don't need shirtless dudes stretching their hips I need Mom saying um I woke up every day and I had this problem I just I just thought it was I'm getting old that's it and then they put me on this you know 21 Day program by Dr knee and Dr knee thank you so much I now walk pain-free I walk my dog I can play with my grandkids thank you so much Dr knees and we need Dr knees as the brand and we need the testimonial not being ripped shirtless guy stretching his hips it needs to be you know what do they call it the silver tsunami or whatever like it used to be somebody with a little gray hair saying how they used to not be able to just you know do simple stuff in the kitchen and get out getting out of bed and now they can I I mean I don't know what else to say other than yeah I agree uh the company um was it called uh what was the thing that it's like I I have one is it hypervolt I forget one of the one of those like either hypervolt or therageous they said I remember the scene their pitch when they raised money they go we want to be the Nike for recovery and right I actually don't I think is the thing is it hyper ice I think that'd be challenging to pull off because they're just kind of selling like a product that's a bit commoditized now just like this vibrating thing uh but they've done a pretty good job with The Branding but I think that that pitch was quite interesting and I actually think it has legs I think challenging but it has legs and I think you could also have like a Nike for you know like pain-free like like I actually do think that that's like there is something quite interesting there with that yeah the way calm did around meditation if someone did around just getting rid of pains that you think you have to live with but actually can be reversed do you have pain I don't but like like for example my trainer he trains he trains me but he also trains my mom he trains my neighbor who's like the CEO of a big tech company but then he also trains his mom and in fact my neighbor who's the CEO of a tech company he will miss sessions all the time because like you know whatever he's on calls and [ __ ] like that but his mom never misses it and she's never worked out like she didn't have a gym membership so she went from 900 gym membership to having a personal trainer and would you see what he'd has her do it's like is this a library like you're stationary for like 90 of the workout and it's like yeah if she's sitting down flat footage she's just trying to push up from like you know her toes because her toes are incredibly weak and that's causing a whole bunch of structural issues so he just works toes then ankles then he gets to the to the calf and the hamstring then the knee you know and he's just working his way up rebuilding it and she's like mowing her lawn now like she couldn't like walk basically like she could from my neighbor's house to my house she basically couldn't get there each day and now she's literally mowing her lawn and um and that's like kind of a kind of kind of a crazy recovery why don't you just get ripped just do that also I'm trying your boy likes cheese okay there's a little bit of a problem so I I'm gonna have to show you a shirtless pick because oh so I like it got really strong and then over the past like eight weeks I've lost 15 pounds and I'm trying to like I just like to try to do things so now I'm trying to get skinny and everyone's like how are you doing it and the answer is I just don't really eat you just be hungry all the time and my trainer my trainer was like well what's your goal and he I go uh I want to look good naked and live forever and uh he was like cool well one of the proven things that makes that people live for a long for a long time is calorie restriction so just not eating a lot so if you want to live for a long time you just got to get used to not eating a lot so I'd be getting used to it and it's not so bad it's not so bad but it is kind of bad it's pretty bad I'm on that Warren Buffett kick bro I try to live till 95 Rich happy telling great stories eating like [ __ ] but enjoying every every meal as you drink like a Coke Zero a Coke Zero that's my Splurge I drink a Coke Zero and I drink a Fresca that's my drink you ever drink a Fresca here's another service someone who has the exact same life scenario as you but is fit we'll send you a

announce the category I think and there we go kind of round robin um last year we did it where we kind of picked who had the best answer after each one I don't know if you guys want to do that or uh any any adjustments to the format here well I think by the way your order was a little off so for example if we're going to start with Billy of the year then that has the next person because it's also a the next category should be craziest person of the year as well okay okay well let's do it this way um we'll take turns uh me and you say I'm just picking categories and then uh you can go whatever order you want so okay let's start let's start with Billy of the year uh so for those who don't know we do the segment called Billy of the week where we typically will feature a billionaire or somebody who maybe is not actually technically a billionaire but they carry themselves with that billionaire energy and uh somebody who's just doing life in an interesting way so Sam who is your Billy of the Year ah mine's so boring so okay uh my boric answer is Zuck because he's proven that like he's actually pretty good all these everyone else this year that's been in his category has gone [ __ ] insane Bezos got a divorce elon's crazy all Zuck does is box that's like his version of crazy like he's turned out to be okay so I would say he's probably like emotionally stable huh yeah he's done all right but if I had to pick another one it would be this guy named Brett Adcock Brett Adcock is this guy I met about six months ago he basically is only 34 to 36 years old he's a young guy he made a lot of money when he sold his company called veteri for 100 million dollars then he created veterans like a recruiting company he's not sexy but then he created a flying drone company that he took public called Archer it was worth two or three billion at its peak now he told me that he's uh took roughly 200 million dollars of his own money which I think was like the majority of his liquid net worth other than the house that he owns and he's piled all of it into bootstrapping a new robotic company called uh where they make humanoids and that guy's pretty [ __ ] insane and I love crazy people like that that's a great one Andrew who you got Billy of the year so my mine is actually a MFM guest Palmer lucky um I feel like you know it's a little obvious but I feel like um you see so many of these billionaires who they make all this money and then they get very focused on PR and they're very safe and they won't put their money where their mouth is and what I loved about him is that a he's actually taking his own capital and investing it in and drill and doing something that is actually important in the world or what he deems important and he actually just like calls people out like he's honest he's not a politician and I think most of these billionaires you talk to they are very political they have a PR team he obviously does not I thought that was so awesome when he went to the uh what is it the all-in conference and just roasted calcamus for like an hour um so yeah mad respect I think he's awesome and I thought that was one of the best interviews of the year that's a great one um I love that one I thought I considered Palmer lucky as well I decided to go with somebody a little more under the radar not a billy not a billionaire but somebody who lives like I think a billionaire should so it's this guy who came to Camp MFM which was our kind of like private retreat of 20 or 30 badass people that we did who Al no Syed Saeed said so Saeed is a guy I didn't know much about you had mentioned him before I didn't I never met him he might be a billionaire he might be but uh but it doesn't matter he lives like one so when we met him at the camp I was like so what do you do he first of all he just had the most chill energy he was not stressed he was not worried he was not seeking attention he was he had none of those small boy traits and instead he was relaxed he was having fun he was asking people questions and I asked him I said so what do you what do you do and he's like well you know I and he he started to explain and somebody else cut him off and was like let me brag for you for a second here so what Syed owns is basically the largest collection of Wordpress websites and tools so if you search for WordPress like you know WordPress powers like 30 or 40 of all internet websites and so people are often searching how do I do this on my WordPress site you'll land typically on one of his websites like wpbeginner or WP engine or whatever and from there it'll say well if you want to capture emails of people who come in using Wordpress like a email capture pop-up use optinmonster owned by also Saeed and so he basically has the landing spot where people come he's got the number one search rankings then he owns the tools that he refers and so he turned his random curious traffic into SAS subscribers it basically built an Empire he's telling us about the gas stations he owns and all the other crazy stuff he does with his money and his work style was was one that I envy he's like well here's my month the last week of the month I do all my meetings with the operators of my businesses I was like so what do you do the other three weeks and he's like one egg one to one and a half weeks we travel so we just go to Costa Rica then we go to Egypt then we go wherever like me my family we just love to travel and then I read and I just chill out and I think uh the other the other week and a half I play with my son a lot we play basketball and I was like wow this guy is dominating his business Niche but he's also checking the Box on family he's checking the Box on travel he's got it going on so I was really impressed by Syed this he also very very uh giving too he he gives away a lot of money too yeah amazing guy so uh so he's mine that's uh all right so those are the billies of the year I I'll just put it out there I think Palmer was the right answer what do you think Sam I agree Palmer was the right answer you're if you haven't seen the clip of him going to Jason calacanus's conference like going to someone's birthday party and roasting them uh that was epic Andrew did you hear on our pod when we asked Palmer if you could kick Jason's ass yeah when he was talking about his scare his like how tall he was he goes yeah he was like well you know if you look at the physics of this I I forget exactly how he explained it but he was like a very engineer he goes like six one yeah he said something like that like it it was pretty funny all right let's go to the next category Sam you can pick one um let's talk about the biggest L we each took this year okay Andrew you go first Adrian by the way this category the biggest l so it's the biggest loss you took but it can be it doesn't have to be like a big serious thing it's just it's just a loss that you put in the in the Lost column however big or small it was in your life yeah so I read this book about 15 years ago by this guy ramit Sethi uh he's got a website I will teach you to be rich and he's got a book called I will teach you to be rich and at the time I knew absolutely nothing about personal finance or Finance at all and he had this really great section where he says people think they need to save money on lattes what they actually need to save money on is percentages and so he's talking about interest rates on credit cards interest rates on mortgage uh fees and real estate transactions like the difference between two percent and 2.5 percent is like twenty thousand dollars and people don't think about that he says uh he goes don't worry about three dollar problems worry about worry about thirty thousand dollar problems exactly so I had one of those um so you know maybe like two episodes of you know a couple interviewers ago I talked about um you know interest rates and the risks there and this was very top of mind because we had a piece of debt in the company that uh I wanted to lock in the interest rate on one and so we were going to buy all these Hedges and in order to do that I had to sign all these documents and I'm kind of lazy I hate signing documents and so these documents were sitting in our office and I was like oh I'll do it tomorrow I'll do it tomorrow I kept putting it off and then finally I signed it and I realized that between the time that I it was sitting there for a week and in that week the interest rate went up by like one percent and that represented like five hundred thousand dollars or something insane and so just me being lazy and not signing that document and not thinking in percentages cost me like 500 Grand that's a great one um this year I met a guy who had an app called intro it's a great app and I agreed to do it because he was like hey come try this and I did and it was one of the big bigger mistakes of the year that I made so basically I'm on this app called intro where for a little while people could you you were bragging about how you were crushing it on intro how is this the L that's such a weak move on my part to do it so this app I got on there because I was like oh you know and honestly it's fun it is quite fun to use it's fun to like meet new people but people pay me for my time and it's quite addicting because it's real you can make a substantial amount of money doing that but if I'm supposed to be such a big swing of dick if I'm supposed to be a hot shot like I want to be I shouldn't be selling my time or at least I shouldn't be selling my time and keeping the money I should just give it away and it was that was a big uh that was a weak move on my part to uh be selling my time and I regret doing that that's a that's a great one I was making fun of you for that and uh and then I was also kind of like wait should I be doing that that is a lot of money don't sell your time don't sell your time such short-term thinking and you know who really changed my opinion of it who actually could be Billy the year what's the guy Brian Johnson Brian Johnson from um uh Braintree he like kind of like didn't mean to do it but he like was razzmy on using it and I was like you're right what did I say that wasn't he was telling us well he told the story he didn't he wasn't directing it towards me but he told the story about how he was like instead of like getting this job like I should just put more effort into my company so then in three years this won't even be a problem instead of right now I could just make this money that could temporary fix this no I should go for the long-term fix and make it so like I don't even have to budget ever again yeah I see a lot of so I think like all three of us kind of probably grew up not having a ton of money um and really really valuing like every dollar right so like I remember um you know a thousand dollars was like a crazy amount of money to me because I could buy an iMac and if I bought an iMac then I could have one of my staff do all this work and I could make like twenty thousand dollars from it and so I feel like I still if I I'm not careful I think in those terms and when someone comes along and offers you a thousand dollars an hour it's like completely insane as an opportunity or like three grand an hour or four grand for an hour it is crazy it's amazing but you get and I know all these people that are like I know guys that are worth 50 million dollars and they still manage their own Airbnb bookings and they'll be like oh sweet I tweaked this I made an extra 300 in cleaning fees or whatever and I always think like you guys used a quote before but it's like you're playing you're playing a pennies or sorry you're you're saving pennies in a dollars game like it's just ridiculous yeah that's uh yeah but some people enjoy that like Nathan Barry uh Nathan Berry owns convertkit he's probably worth 200 plus million dollars based off the valuation convertkit and he's still I'll be with him and applaud his phone and he's like messaging Airbnb guests I'm like why are you doing this he goes I love it and so in that case I'm like all right cool I don't like taking intro calls necessarily sometimes I do but uh yeah yeah there's a there's a good test I remember I talked to this guy when we got acquired by twitch I talked to a guy who had been acquired by twitch three years ago and I was like yo let's get lunch so we go out for lunch and I'm like um you know he's like yeah you're gonna love it you know yeah but watch out for this he's like giving me a bunch of tips I'm like okay great um let me give you a tip real quick uh yeah I just got here but let me give you a tip I was like why are you still here and he's like oh dude um I really like my job actually you know I I didn't think I would stay here but I really like it you know it's it's fun I just blah blah he tells you tell me how great it is but I had kind of seen him in a couple meetings at this point and I was like these meetings aren't fun so like you know I don't know what you're doing the other hours a day but I saw you for like half a day last week and that that didn't seem fun at all um I said okay well maybe it is fun but let me just ask you something um you made you know he probably made like 10 20 million dollars on sale I said uh I said you don't need this job but uh but but you're not at the point where for you you're just gonna stop working all together blah blah and I said uh I said if you had 100 million dollars in the bank like literally like if I open up your bank account right now is 100 million dollars just sitting there would you come into work tomorrow like would you would you would you do this just for fun because at that point you know what you're making here every year is a rounding error it's a you you just make that in in an interest uh if you were uh if you had 100 million dollars sitting there he's like well no then I would go do XYZ and I was like okay cool so this as long as we're just being honest like I'm not saying you're miserable here I agree but the stories we tell ourselves in order to justify doing something that we're actually doing for the money but we don't want to say we're doing it for the money we want to say we're doing it for all these other reasons there's a very simple test imagine you had all the money would you still do this thing and like but the other the other the dangerous thing about that logic so Ryan holiday has this great daily stoic podcast and re recently he had um a excerpt from Stephen pressfield's book he's got all these books about kind of discovering your thing and your Mastery and art and all this kind of stuff and he talks about how people get addicted to patterns so people can be addicted to um love they they can be addicted to money they could be addicted to you know any almost anything and the question I always ask myself is I might love designing the website or I might love going into the Shopify stats and seeing the sales or doing the Airbnb management but is that just me addicted to those dopamine hits distracting myself from my greater purpose right from doing something where I have Mastery that's new am I just going back to the same thing right like you guys know the joy there's this amazing confirmation bias Joy of reading a book and hearing something you already know confirmed over and over and over again I'll do this with like uh value investing books right and I'll go oh I already know that I do that I feel good right that's actually a waste of time and so that's the flip side of it the other one is uh my buddy told me this when I when I'd been working on my startup for six or seven years and he was like he's like he told me he's like you know I just don't get what you're doing I was like well what do you mean I can explain it and he's like no not the logic of it he's like I just feel like let me ask you a question if this all went away is this what you would sign up to go do like would you basically like like take the example of the guy I was talking to if you got if you weren't doing this job is it would you just apply for this job here no you would go do something completely different like you're here because you got Acquired and then you're here and now fast forward three or four years later you're still here doing the same job but if I took this job away you would never go to a job posting and apply for this job and he's and so he was explaining that he's like you know inertia is just a [ __ ] he's like whatever your an object in motion will stay in motion whatever you're doing you're probably most likely you're doing it because you were already doing it not because you think it's the thing you actually should do in most cases and so you got to be really aware of that all right um so what's yours okay so uh wait what is the category even what are we in your biggest l oh my biggest L okay I have one that's sort of like yours I was chasing pennies in a dollar game so I recently moved and uh your boy rents I'm a renter and so I moved from one rental to another a new house and I was like oh I love this I could just like move whenever I want don't have to worry about anything just call the movers I broke my lease I just moved but um my landlord came in and uh first you know did a walk through of the place when I was there you know we talked about his you know his family his history in this house shook hands in the garage said you know it's been nice having you all right see you later you know don't worry about all the stuff everything looks fine three weeks later he hits me with like a 20 or 30 000 bill and um at least twenty thousand he gets me with the extra twenty thousand dollar bill on the move out for like you know scratches and like you know stuff like with he right no he was not right it was and he had he's a lawyer so he had baked into the lease that like hey anything that's associated with the move out is your cost like for example if I fly to California to observe the move out you have to pay for my flights my hotels my food my this my like there's a [ __ ] in there that was like not like I didn't damage the property it was just like extra stuff but he had put it in the lease I had signed the lease because like you know like Andrew I don't really I I don't really read it or if I read it I'm not going to read what are words yeah it's like uh you know I'm optimistic at the beginning of things I'm like this is gonna go great he's gonna be a chill dude just like I would be well he's never gonna hold me to any of these things and like sure enough he held me to the letter of the law and every single thing and so he so I decide to do something that we talked about on this uh on this podcast I decided to take him to Petty court and so a lawyer a guy who listened to the Pod who's a lawyer reaches out he's like yo I heard about the landlord thing I'm ready to fight to the death on this for free and I was like let's do this and so in my head I was like I'm gonna fight this 20 grand got this lawyer now he's got Troy you know he's a great dude um got to know him a little bit through this process but we try fighting back we and the problem is I'm going against an 87 year old retired lawyer who's got nothing not my time on his hands he this is probably the biggest thrill he's had in 37 years to fight and be and you know like look up every California statute and he sends me these packets of like 47 documents he sends me CD-ROMs full of photos of the property I'm like dude I don't have a CD player to put this in what about how am I supposed to see these photos and he's just sending me letter after letter and he's I took a guy to Petty Court who is like the king of petty court and in the end I end up paying the full amount just by saying eff it and I'm like because I'm like dude I'm wasting my time I'm wasting this lawyer's time I might say this old guy's time but he's got infinite time and uh he is built for this whereas I should have just wrote this 20K check and just moved on with my life five weeks ago and I knew it because at night when before I was going to sleep I was up I was like oh [ __ ] I didn't respond to that [ __ ] subpoena he sent me basically this like giant package of letters I was like okay I'm gonna call him I'm gonna say this he's gonna say that I was like imagining this whole debate in my head I was like dude what a waste of mental space and once I finally had that realization that I was playing a small boy game by losing my mental like my mental space in my head that could be done used on productive things in order to be in petticort I wrote the check and I moved on with my life dude I think it's worth fighting those things by the way no no it's 100 dude going to war for the sake of war is worth it I had the Sam on my shoulder and I had the Andrew on my shoulder and I listened to the salmon I should have never listened to the Sam I wasted four weeks of my life that's like you're you're like a bull in a china shop and there's this tiny little fly buzzing on you and you just have to ignore it there's a great quote on this that someone said to me once when I was going through something similar and the guy said Never Wrestle a pig you'll both get dirty but the pig will enjoy it yeah that is exactly there's no problem I'm the pig here I'm the pig here what I I had Sean I had the you know my situation yeah I had something like this go on this year too and I texted Andrew I go what do I do and he said the same thing he goes don't wrestle with pigs or whatever this [ __ ] biblical [ __ ] and I bought into it and it eats me it eats me every night that someone that someone got someone I got got you there's what's the Charlie Munger calls it um the rats and The Granary right if you own a granary you have a big Warehouse full of grain there's gonna be rats you can keep killing them over and over again but they're gonna always come back and it's better to just accept that there's rats out there said we got rats at your Granary bro yeah okay let's go to the next one okay cool um all right let's go to the next category let's do we're gonna do breakout company which is sort of the sexy one and then let's do the unsexy business of the year so we'll do we'll do both first let's do the uh the breakout company of the year uh Andrew you want to go first yeah I mean this is so obvious but I and I I came up with a few others but I just I feel like we both want to say the same obvious thing where everyone's gonna say the same eye open AI open AI gpt3 is shocking I think this is like a watershed moment and uh I there's nothing else I haven't seen anything like this in probably 10 years I have two words for you guys that that will change your opinion yeah liver King what this guy called his shot man that's the trooper you're gonna tell me that that dude when you have Elon Musk and Sam Altman and 10 billion dollars that's not a breakout company that's not a breakout that's just that's a company that they are who we thought they were they did exactly what we thought they were gonna do that that doesn't count as a breakup you're saying you expected you expected like when I I remember a friend of mine called me about a month before they released the chat and was like oh my God it's amazing and I kind of rolled my eyes you know I didn't wasn't super excited about it but I have not seen anything this crazy in a very long time I mean obviously Dolly and stuff is insane too but the chat it's just nuts I've actually stopped using Google a lot of the time and started using the chat do well look they you took the nerdiest of nerds the smartest guys on Earth and who gave them 10 billion dollars and he locked him in a room for six years yeah but like if you knew their friends if it was 1945 and you're like what's the breakout project of the year and I'm like it's the Manhattan Project and you're like oh well this got billions of dollars and whatever it's still [ __ ] crazy they made a nuclear bomb it's crazy this is like a nuclear bomb moment it's just like my expectations they met my expectations like If This Were if this were like uh if this was like a second grade report report card it would definitely be like met expectations there would not be there would not be like yeah yeah this is not an exceed I kind of felt like it was a goofy project I was like oh you know Google Apple all these other people they're gonna do this for you know they have a huge incentive profit incentive these guys are going like non-profit when they first started and it's kind of like all about openness and whatever it's morphed into something that I didn't expect and I certainly didn't expect it to do as well as it did given all the star power I think often think about like super groups super groups are usually not that good it was like a super group yeah I mean the Avengers worked out but yeah I feel you I I feel you I mean like in music so Sam yours your your breakout person or company is liver King not AI I mean yeah we're Andrew Tate but yeah one of those guys we did an episode where we detailed the leaked emails from the liver King where he's like yo I'm gonna take a bunch of steroids I'm gonna build this brand and then I'm gonna sell like 100 million dollars worth of products that's what I'm gonna do and then he did it so that's so much more dope all right let me merge the tune so Sam you like the call your shotness Andrew you're like wow open at my Sam Altman you guys have done something magical I'm gonna give you a called shot that I think is kind of unbelievable to be honest with you okay so Paul Graham is going to win my award here for calling it they call your shot moment so back in 2009 Paul Graham wrote a blog post so this is now what like 13 years ago or something like that Paul Graham writes a blog post it's called if you go to paulgram.com Five Founders the number five in the founders he says inc.com recently asked me oh yeah my most interesting Founders are the last 30 years he goes how do you decide who's interesting I think it's influence you know who are the five have influenced me the most who do I use as examples when I'm talking to companies that I'm funding who do I find myself quoting a lot and it's everybody you would expect it's Steve Jobs is number one he's got Larry and Sergey from Google he's got like his buddy but Paul bukite who uh invented Gmail and also wrote the first prototype for AdSense and gave Google the Mantra of don't be evil okay everything's expected so far and number five he says Sam Altman hey guys I was told I shouldn't mention who at the time by the way was 22 I think right yeah exactly at the time he's probably 21 or 22 years old and he was wearing he was wearing double pop neon colors with Steve Jobs exactly very embarrassing put up a photo of him doing this uh uh announcement at the at the Apple conference where he's wearing a double Polo neon popped collar uh it's it's really incredible you wouldn't think that that guy's gonna rule the world but but Paul Graham knew that he would so he's here's what he wrote about Sam Alvin back in 2009 he goes I shouldn't mention a YC founder um but Sam Altman cannot be stopped by flimsy rules if he wants to be on this list he is going to be honestly Sam is along with Steve Jobs the founder I refer to most when I'm advising startups on question of design I asked what would Steve do but on a question of strategy or ambition I ask what would samma do uh when when I learned meeting Sama is that the doctrine applies the doctrine of the elect applies to Startup it applies in a way that that it applies way less than most people think startup investing is not about picking winners you think might win a horse race because there are a few people with such force of will that they are going to get whatever they want and now you fast forward 13 years the guy you know basically creates this you know what's going to be a multi probably a multi-hundred billion dollar Company open Ai and brings you know one of the most magical technical like magical technology experiences which is if you're if you're using dolly or gpt3 he created and he wasn't even that successful back then by the way I don't think he had I think he I think he had sold a company but he sold it was less than they raised I don't think he sold it even at that point so let me see when it was called loot yeah it was loot um and I think they made they sold it for about 43 million dollars he sold it three years later so this was he was at the beginning of loot he sold it for 43 million and uh and I think and I I remember reading about the sale there were some there's some interesting stuff about how he uh like they sold it for less than it than it was funded for right which is like you know considered an L uh but he but he sold it in a way that he was able to pocket a few million bucks he then invested in Airbnb right away and was the first seed investor in Airbnb he's got this like you know he went on kind of an epic run post that um yeah he's a crazy guy I think that's uh that's got to be the breakout is I agree maybe Sam Altman this time can beat the liver King but it's close we could all agree you know tomato tomato the most impressive thing about liver King is he's not a good looking dude like some of these guys you see in their influencers and they're like super jacked and handsome he's not a good looking he's my example when I say I I told sahil Bloom this because saho Bloom is like the good looking version of me I was like hey if I can't be good looking I'm gonna be interesting looking and uh that's what the liver King did he's not good looking but he decided to be really [ __ ] interesting looking and that works just as well uh I then we'll have to go with Sam Altman gets it this time all right let's do unsexy business um oh dude I didn't even know what you meant by that well you go first an unsexy business is like when we do our our blue collie uh blue collar Billy of the week what do we call this [ __ ] the blue collar side hustle uh it's like a business that's not artificial intelligence or flying cars or whatever it's just like a boring unsexy business how are you confused by this this is like the premise of our podcast but I don't know all right well what podcast uh so what's yours all right I'm gonna go with um I could go with uh egg cartons but I think I've kind of beat that one to death the egg cartons.com if you haven't heard me rant about that go look up that episode that is honestly that is the most remarkable one this woman Sarah Moore but if not that I'm gonna go with one we haven't talked about that much on here it's called Aunt Flo have you heard of this business no so what are you saying the word ant I like ant I'm saying flow yeah ant flow okay all right you could say it your way sorry I just wanted to make sure that this the it's the word that we're using okay yeah so I am flow so amp flow is a business that is basically um it's period products I don't know how I'm supposed to say this but for uh it's period products so basically you go to a public restroom inside of any University a stadium whatever in the women's restroom they uh should have and now in many states they are mandating that you have to have you know tampons pads products for women and so um normally these were coming in a Dusty raggedy container uh with like really poor hygiene you gotta like open the thing and everyone's like trying to use toilet paper to like touch the thing to open it and it's like really gross I mean this is like you know there's like literally like blood on these products so it's not not like a very it's not not something that you want to touch it's not a sexy experience and what she did was she brought a sexy experience to a very unsexy industry so if you go look at their dispensers they basically made like the Tesla of of dispensers and they install it on the wall it's got this great brand she's this great founder and they are just cleaning up so they are getting conscious with universities with what and these are multi-year contracts it's installed on the wall this thing is never going to get changed it's gonna be no churn is my prediction and it's sort of like they installed a dispenser and then they have to buy the products as they as they're used or as they run out and um and she calls herself the CEO the chief estrogen officer she's just gone all in on like building this company as a woman-led company that's like making this one kind of crappy experience better and I asked her I was like did you invest in this yeah I was like I've never been in a woman's restroom before uh what's the current like who's the incumbent who are you competing against and she's like literally it's a guy named like a brand called Bob and Rick and like Bob and Rick's dispensers are like the thing and you know it's this terrible experience and we're making it better and so they're at like you know they're definitely at a sort of like high seven figures uh uh run rate where they have all these great contracts and they you know they're they're the official dispenser for all the Apple Stores and for like you know the whole state of you know I don't know Utah or whatever some State that's like mandated this can happen and I think once one state does it all these states are gonna do it so I think they're very well positioned to take a very boring Niche and build a pretty badass business and she's a teal fellow only 25 years old yeah air coder I think her name is that's right that's a good one do you have one Andrew yeah okay so um hotels are constantly trying to save money especially chains and I don't know if you've ever gone to like a hotel chain you'll notice that on the wall if it's like a cheaper one they'll have like dispensers for shampoo and soap and it's all refillable right so the idea is like you used to go to a hotel and there'd be a bar of soap in a box and you open the bar of soap and you use it to clean your ass and then they have to throw it away right so um it's a huge waste they're constantly throwing money away and so hotels have moved to these refillable things but one thing that um they can't do is toilet paper so when you go and there's a full roll of toilet paper and you use some of it you know no one wants to go into a hotel and be like oh what the heck there's like a little bit of toilet paper left there's obviously someone just here who used it and so there's someone I just heard about this business it hasn't launched yet but I thought it was fascinating basically it's a dispenser for toilet paper so it's on it actually embeds in the wall all and you basically pull out almost like you would Kleenex perfectly portion toilet paper and I don't think this would necessarily work at like a Four Seasons or a high-end place but certainly for like a Marriott or a Hilton I think they could save tons of money so I thought that was just incredibly boring and quite interesting that's a great one all right that's a good one there was one that got big doing that with uh with the shampoo bottles back in the day they would take the once used shampoo bottle and they would recycle it basically and they were just like hey Hotel will pay you nothing for it but we'll come collect it for you we'll just take it off your hands because you're just this is just trash for you and they created so have you guys invested in any boring businesses like I you know I give Nick Huber a little bit of money I think you did yeah what else what other boring stuff have you guys done uh I'm in enduring so they buy you know the same kind of boring businesses that's kind of tech I mean like I mean like brick and mortar uh development of real estate like Townhomes I feel like we it's weird because I feel like half of what we talk about on this podcast is like these Boring Brick and Mortar businesses and yet we like and we like fetishize them we don't own that many of them like yeah I own a uh an air uh air ambulance business um I you know I own a deli and bakery a bunch of kind of restaurants and that kind of stuff wait what the but I want to get your ambulance oh like helicopters ambulance so if you're like in Mexico and you need to be brought home and you've you've had a surgery or something we facilitate that um it's a very good business but I really want more of those things have you guys ever thought about like starting like a fund around that or something because I feel like it's a lot of words yeah I like to visit I don't really live there we don't have to operate you don't have to operate us just invest in all these cash flowing boring businesses I I whenever people talk about that I'm like where do you find that like like you're going to eBay like where do you like where do you find this air ambulance thing you know what I mean yeah it was like we had to we met someone through a friend of a friend it's always like someone's dad right it's like oh you know his his dad wants to retire and the kids don't want the business or something like that or these things happen at the golf course yeah I don't know yeah I should be doing that I I think I got like really Tech brainwashed because I basically I started a sushi restaurant then I moved to Australia and did like a biotech thing but then I moved to Silicon Valley when I was 24 and I was like basically I just got like really deep in the Silicon Valley kind of ethos and game and that was my that's my network and that's my my skills were around internet companies and so I think it was kind of the right move to go deep there and try to like win in that World um because I think you don't have to win in all games so like you know I have a fun to do startup investing like if I do good with if I do great with startup investing I'll do great I don't really need to also do great with a very different style of investing so I think I'm curious about it but um you know do I want to like sort of restart the learning curve in a new way but one you know you guys have this crazy advantage of you know I think your your rolling fund as well because of the podcast right so if you guys go on and you say hey who has a Granddad or a father or a mother who owns this family business that wants to sell I feel like you'd get mobbed there's something let's see all right Sean at seanpuri.com all those leads can go to me then if you guys don't want let's let's see what comes in I'll share all the interesting I'll filter all the interesting ones uh for you Andrew so Sean at seanpuri.com email me your your dad your granddad your uncle's business that we could either take like a minority stake or maybe he's looking to retire itself let's see let's see what we got um okay so those are the ones um dude you know I I did it but I I was reading about coffeezilla going deep on Andrew Tate's thing do you guys know how Andrew Tate makes money I do but go ahead he basically he has this well okay fine you got that smug look on your face it's like a cam girl's business right like it's a definition of a sexy person no no the real way to make money is yeah he's got this [ __ ] Discord that's 50 a month in order to like join and there's like channels on like copywriting it's basically just the same [ __ ] that you and I Sean have done like screwing around except do you know how big it is it's like tens of 150 million yeah no no no no no no like a million members oh wow like we're talking nine figures in revenue and coffee Zilla like did it he's like look here's all the members if you multiply that by 50 and then you can even add a discount to it it's like we're talking about north of 100 million in revenue and it's just a Discord with voluntary with volunteer community like chairs like Community leads freaking crazy and uh I considered saying for breakout person but I you know he's obviously pretty controversial so I didn't want to like I'm the breakout is I've never seen somebody go from nobody to everywhere all the time in your face the way this guy has like he built a crazy in like seven months or something like that like had you ever heard this word before Andrew Tate last year like no no I think he was the most Googled person on Earth this year that's crazy to me is that crazy and he says it and when he when he does his interviews he goes he goes Mr Beast has to spend five million dollars and blow up blow up a bus in order to get 10 million views I said I said I just talk yeah and it's true it's true the guy's way of speaking and the the things he says are so compelling and then he built this viral engine where his all hustles University is is basically yo post cut cut up clips of Tate everywhere and then go comment and basically in the comments Revere me and that's how you know and then everybody who signs up for the professor University you're gonna make money doing that like that's basically the core job is like go promote me um it's crazy it's insane it is crazy it's a multi-level marketing scheme just promoting him he is the product it's wild all right so what's uh do we vote on that one or just move to a different topic uh yeah vote okay let's do our best investment so the best investment you made and then we're gonna do worst investment also so let's start with uh let's start with best investment let's go Sam what was the best investment you made 2022 financially [ __ ] none this year was in terms of money this was horrible uh the two best uh Investments I made were getting Fitness coaches so nutritionists and and like a lifting coach a fitness coach and then also this pod this is like the first time Sean this year where like and this is actually one of my most proud moments where I've been walking around and I get noticed maybe one to three times a day and this is the first time that I'm like oh wow Sean the work that you and I have done over four or five hundred episodes it's like properly paid off yeah so that's this part is this this year it felt different has it ever has ever been annoying or yeah one time like it's there's been multiple times where Sarah and I are having like a serious conversation or we're arguing or we're having like a contentious conversation and someone pops up and like you gotta like like oh hey yeah hi hi yeah you gotta like turn it on and that kind of sucks it's like you know like when you and your wife get in a fight but then you got to get in the car together to go to like your friend's house for dinner and you gotta put on like the performance of the century that's kind of like how it feels sometimes there's a there's a uh what's her name from The Hunger Games Jennifer Lawrence her name Lawrence she talked about how she can be nice to a thousand people but if one time she's fighting with her boyfriend and she's kind of a [ __ ] to somebody they'll go on Reddit and post about it and she feels like you basically always have to be that person and it's only a matter of time until you snap knowing you it's only a matter of time one time we are at um you know we're we're exploring the pregnancy thing this year and one time we were at the baby baby doctors and someone in the waiting room said something to me and uh I was I was I didn't I was rude apology there all right I'll do a quick one okay so best financial investment I invest in this company called triple will that's basically like a uh it's a tool for Shopify store owner so it helps you like see your dashboard and uh make sure your ads are working well and they have like a bunch of different features I invest in this thing because I I was like oh I like this I want to use this for my Ecom store maybe I should just invest in it really didn't think this was gonna I thought if and I did this by the way I took my portfolio and I ranked like what do I think are going to be the breakouts and what do I think are least likely to be the breakouts because I I suspected I might be surprised I was very surprised so us I think our 75 000 investment in triple whale is currently worth 3.3 million and so uh that's been the the biggest breakout from the fund so far and it's would have been one of the five that I did not guess would be this explosive rocket ship because like that's just not how I thought about it back then like when I saw it it looked like this cool Analytics tool for Ecom you know Shopify stores I don't know how big that is I don't know how fast it'll grow it's been insane so that's my financial one and then I'll also say um we did Camp MFM and that was an amazing investment I'll tell you a little little story about it so we did this camp 20 30 people we go to North Carolina and we fly in this NBA trainer so we pay for his kind of him and his buddy like they're they're uh fights at hotels or whatever we rent these airbnbs we do the camp it's great everybody chipped in I think like a thousand bucks or 1500 bucks two grand or something yeah I thought I thought that would cover the cost didn't quite cover it I think we're in the whole like 15 grand or something like that no problem uh amazing experience just for the basketball all the fun meeting people all that good stuff but something kind of crazy happened um we tweeted out that we were hanging with Mr Beast or something like that or that uh that maybe the Pod we recorded with Mr Beast and a guy saw that started following Ben Levy Ben Levy then checks out this guy's profile um oh this guy's in the crypto space DM's him oh let's talk you know maybe they'll advertise with us we end up getting an acquisition offer from this person that's not the deal we ended up going with but it gave us the leverage in the deal we did end up going with uh and like opened this door into acquisition and it's all like if we hadn't tweeted out that thing that we were doing with Mr Beast I don't think this person would have followed and then I don't think that conversation would happen and so the world Works in these really funny ways where this like kind of amazing acquisition we had this year I don't know they could have just as easily not happened or been for a lot less had we not like just done this totally unrelated thing that's good good things happen because it's great all right Andrew what you got best investment so Mine mine's actually an investment I made a couple years ago but it's taken a while to play out and it's very small um but I really like this one so um you guys know Sophia Amoroso I think she's been on the podcast before um I met Sophia like five or six years ago and she just had the experience with nasty gal and she's like I'm trying to figure out what to do next I've written this book called girl boss and I've kind of built this community around it this social following I want to turn it into a business and I said like look you know I think you should bootstrap this but she got mobbed with uh VCS and so it was easy money great valuation raised like 10 million bucks or something and because she took VC money she had this really wonderful business but she had to turn into a billion dollar thing and this is girl so suddenly this is girl boss and so she uh you know raised all this money and she's like I'm gonna build basically like LinkedIn slash like a social network for female entrepreneurs to connect them which we all know is like the world's biggest lift it's like oh my most impossible to start a social network and so she ended up running out of cash getting exhausted she sold it to attention capital and they basically were just like [ __ ] we don't know what to do about this like we we shouldn't have bought this and so they reached out to us and we were able to buy it for a really really cheap just because the business was totally distressed um and so you know we looked at it and we're like okay like let's just go back to basics this business has almost 2 million social followers and email subscribers and we just did basic stuff we built a daily email newsletter we sold ads we did social ads we did affiliate we rebooted the podcast brought on a great CEO and it's just been this phenomenal base hit and I just got an update from our CEO uh Lulu who's like freaking amazing and basically now the business is I won't say numbers but it's making as much as we paid for it every year in profit and I think it's probably 5 or 10x more valuable than what we paid for it at least um so I I just love that kind of stuff where we're able to take a business that shouldn't have raised venture or you know kind of failed in Venture Land and actually make it a sustainable business that'll be going for five or ten years at least that's crazy yeah that's really cool I like those and I think there's gonna be a bunch of those Venture businesses that fail that's another one if you're a venture business and you're not gonna be able to raise the next round because the whole Market is turned or whatever uh it's not over and there's like a way to structure these deals I think most Founders just throw in the towel don't know what to do with that asset but uh again there's a lot there's a lot of these businesses where you let's say a business gets to five or ten million dollars of Revenue and they're burning you know a million two million a month because they're like Venture backed or whatever to the founder you know they're just like okay well this is worth nothing you know let's go sell to Facebook and we'll take it Aqua hire and they actually will throw out their existing business that business has value and people like us and enduring will buy it and turn it around and make you know make it into something that'll actually make them proud um so yeah I mean it's it all is not like enduring to that with up Council that's what that was the example totally can we um we gotta do worship my worst one is a personal real estate like I bought real estate over the last two years and I'm in I'm made money on on all of it so far and like technically speaking like it's all like gonna beat the stock market well that's easy because the stock market sucks but like some of my investment it's like my Airbnb it's still like a eight percent return or something like that but it's just a [ __ ] headache dude I regret buying real estate I wish I didn't own any real estate and I wish I just invested in other people's funds yeah that's my worst investment it just it's caused me a dispersional amount of headache yeah that's a good one uh all right mine is uh mine's really hard to choose so many losers to choose from this year so uh so people know my portfolio is essentially tech stocks and crypto um tech stocks down somewhere between 40 and 85 percent this year crypto down 75 percent this year or sometimes 100 in certain cases uh I think Luna has to be my pick because it went to zero um and so that was just like you know what a 100 loss that happened in like three days so last year this episode last year here's here's Sean's company to watch Tara slash Luna that was his answer I said company to watch and it sure did give you some entertainment yeah you want you watched it go down and then his prediction was that the Winkle VI twins the the Winklevoss twins are gonna be richer than Zuckerberg so that is a long-term prediction but you you bet on Luna so so you're gonna double down this is the question are you gonna double down on your winkle VI prediction and what's the timeline and what's the punishment if you lose no no these are supposed to be crazy predictions these are not supposed to be things I think are going to happen they're sort of like far-fetched predictions no I don't I don't want to double down on that I would say that's looking way less likely now than it did then um but you know it's basically like a Facebook stock got crushed a little bit this year too I I had calculated that I think I forgot what it is now but I think Bitcoin would have needed to be at if Bitcoin got to 2 million dollars a coin then the Winkle and Facebook had like you know uh you know kept his value or something like that based on how much Bitcoin they owned I thought okay at that point they all have surpassed uh a suit but the Hedge was always if Zucker owns any Bitcoin then they can really never pass him um you know if he put a minority stake in but I don't think Zuck cares if the wake of fire are rich or not I I don't think that's a concern of his so what's what's yours Andrew um so mine is really just Venture in general so we I've been doing Angel Investing For 10 plus years and I think I've done well um on a cash basis I've got a lot of money back but I haven't actually like if I think about it um even if I've made 15 to 30 a year I haven't had access to that cash the entire time whereas in my main business when I buy a business and I make you know make 20 or 30 return I'm actually getting that cash and I'm compounding it and then I'm investing it and doing more and more and more and I think psychologically there's a big difference between owning a whole bunch of businesses and doing 50 million dollars in ebitda versus uh owning a bunch of stakes that are a liquid and a bunch of venture businesses where maybe you'll get your money in 10 to 15 years and so I don't think that it's necessarily saying I don't want to invest in Venture go forward but it's just been I think it's been a bad if I think of it as if my goal is to maximize my capital and feel rich it's not the best way to do that I think that I'm much better off incubating businesses and uh buying businesses because it's a very steady 15 to 30 percent cash return and I feel it I feel the win in a much bigger way and I think that like anyone over the last two years there's some businesses where I look at the valuation I invested at and I I knew it at the time I sucked it up and was like [ __ ] you know this is just the world we're in but there's some businesses with like now maybe like four million dollars of Revenue and they raised it like 100 million dollar valuation and I'm just like okay that's just gone yeah well that sucks we all just we all just said horrible things that we did this year I don't know just just bask in the uh in the in the hill Look At You Know You're Gonna you can't you can't have a non-error right you know like you can't be an investor and not have a portfolio of bad Investments of bad decisions right like that is there's not really a thing if you're gonna do this uh and you're gonna take you know the appropriate amount of risk that would get a reward you can't have a zero percent error rate and so I don't think it's anything to be shy of also you know I think a lot of people you know are have portfolios that are down this year just by the nature of like what's going on in the market there's that uh there's that logic brain coming in to save you yeah I know I mean that but that's like a that's where the logic brain is actually like useful all right like I learned this in poker too like you oh I had pocket aces and I lost I literally know people that will fold pocket queens or something like that in poker why because they're traumatized from the bad beat they got one time and there are Jacks I hate Jacks like you what do you mean you hate pocket Jacks why um like why don't you you know just because you got your money in good but it turned out not the way you wanted like you know being able to assess the decision and not the result is so key what I when I'm making fun of myself for for fomoing into Investments it's because I think my decision was bad sure the result was bad but my decision was bad I have many Investments where I think the decision is good and the result might be bad for a period of time that's okay uh but being able to separate the twos is super important I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better um Sam what topic you want to go to which category dude I want to combine book of the year and favorite podcasts or news person newsletter or person you subscribe to so I want to like we'll do a few actionable things like best things that we um yeah like best bit bits of content mine for a favorite person I sort of favorite person is it's two you already named one of them Paul Graham dude Paul Graham is such a beautiful writer I started reading all of his work again this year he's such an awesome writer he talks about money living happiness raising a family he's a really good writer I love reading him the other one is cultural tutor do you guys know who cultural tutor is on Twitter never heard of it so it's this person um who I don't think they're crazy popular but I'm going to give you an example of a thing that they tweeted so it's called It's called The the cultural tutor a beautiful education that's their thing and so they'll do like posts about like um uh I'll I'll let me find a good one but it's all about culture so basically right now uh minimalism is a thing so if you look at like a lot of new buildings minimalism is a thing and the cultural tutor will do this thread saying uh this is actually pretty lame about this architecture it's pretty boring here's the ornate stuff that we used to do and here's why we used to do it and here's why we do minimalism now and it makes you like question uh certain things that we're doing or another one could be um um here's like a famous uh piece of art and it was actually revolutionary uh and here's or here's why Mona Lisa here's why it looks like her eyes are following you and this doesn't seem interesting now but it was interesting because back then here's how they used to do things and here's what was actually revolutionary about that painting things like that I love the cultural tutor it's a really good follow that's a good one um you said you were gonna combine that with book of the year book of the Year Blitz have you ever read Blitz Andrew it's about the story of drug use during World War II I mean you you've got meth and you've got Hitler I mean what could go wrong it's a frame breaking book basically the whole hypothesis was that during World War II you know how like they gave soldiers like pieces of chocolate and cigarettes to keep them happy well and in Nazi Germany era they gave them meth and one of the one of the reasons it says Hitler was being crazy and making a lot of the decisions that he did not only was he like a hateful crazy person but they're saying it was also because he was on meth the whole time and he was going nutty and one of the reasons why he killed himself was he basically ran out of drugs in the last two weeks in his bunker what do you got there Sean is that Blitz right there no this is that place I'm looking at the book I think I'm gonna choose but Andrew go go next so my favorite podcast I'm absolutely obsessed with Founders which is by David senra and what he basically does is he reads business biographies um and then he summarizes them really really well so there's a lot of I've read a lot of business biographies I really enjoy them but there's a lot of them where I'm like I just I'm not gonna spend 15 hours of my life learning about JFK's dad right there's this there's there's always books on my bookshelf that taunt me and so I read that book He's a patriarchy yeah I read about a quarter of it it was great but but um he he'll do like the one one and a half hour summary and so a it's a great way to remind yourself like I I read Titan a couple years ago about John D Rockefeller and I re-listened to it it reminded me of a lot of the lessons and then B it'll actually tell me do I want to read this book is this person actually interesting or just give me a cursory understanding of that person so I absolutely love that one in terms of books the one that I loved over the last year is the operator which is about David Geffen the guy is a absolute lunatic it's fascinating like the picture of him um you know why is he the way he is deep dive on him started he started records I mean this guy this guy was like um he's touched so many Industries you know huge musicians too at this point like yeah I mean yeah fascinating career but also an incredible investor um and capital allocator and stuff but what a fascinating book and it's one of those ones where it's very unflattering but it's incredible okay that's worth like five or ten billion dollars at this point I mean he's like a big deal all right I'll do um book I'm gonna have I got two two picks that I thought were good uh I only read probably three or four books this year but uh this one so think on these things by krishnamurthy that's like a uh life philosophy book that uh bro I love you said that was your favorite book one time and I asked you how far into the book you've read and you said you're on the first three pages yeah actually uh I'm only about 30 pages in now uh so I've gone from three to Thirty in a year I think it might have been my pick last year too um this book is so heavy man it's got like uh let me see how far dude it's not okay it's like 250 Pages 110 pages in um so some 110 pages in and uh it's it's an amazing book the second one is uh Andrew you probably read this richer wiser happier it's a great book for anybody who likes investing um and basically yeah there's a great book for anybody who likes investing I think it's a it's a it's a fun read so uh those are my two favorite books that I read this year and then podcast newsletter or person I'm gonna give two kind of shout outs a person one that's a little under the radar is called 10K diver if you follow this guy on Twitter so yeah the 10K diver the bio just it's the literally it's a number 10 then K diver uh it says I help people understand the fundamentals of finance and investing and um I think it's called 10K diver because it's like the form 10K like the the that's like the the name of the form or whatever so uh he just gives really great threads about like very basic fundamentals of Finance and I find myself reading these and thinking oh surely I know you know about whatever topic it is certainly I know about stock based compensation certainly I know you know whatever cash flow and then you read it and you're like I always learn something from it and I think he's a great writer he's very clear he's very helpful um I just think it's a great great one to follow it's like you know there's a lot of junk food on Twitter and I would say that 10K diver is not junk food I even took his like Maven course um but did you really I I only attended like half of the sessions just because like you know it's hard to make that much time um super interesting dude and uh and you know I I don't know the course wasn't like mind breaking for me but um I don't know it's it's all good stuff it's all good stuff and so I really I really liked uh I really like the way this guy thinks um okay so that's the the person one and okay book so I did book all right we're good we're good on those we all all three did ours yeah all right cool yeah what uh what topic you want to do next wild predictions okay what you got mine's easy I think by the way you want me to read your wild predictions from last year should I read our predictions yeah all right our predictions from last year Sams was um San Francisco is going to be cool again San Francisco will be cool again you think you hit that or no no but I don't think I'm I I I'm I early I'm not off my prediction but I'm but yeah I'm a little early it's gonna come back man because Sanford I went back there it is awesome San Francisco is awesome yeah you said something about the YouTuber meet Kevin and that uh he will be like and his company's gonna break out or something like that I don't know what that prediction was oh yeah I totally was wrong uh totally at home Diagnostics you said was the industry to watch yeah nothing happened there and then you said overrated the Creator economy slash web3 nailed it yeah I emailed that one um Andrew your predictions were that high and high salary inflation is not here to stay companies are going to Outsource an offshore um Talent what do you think about that one I still think it's right I think that it just took I think we're just seeing it now basically as these Tech layoffs happen I think they're going to go globally right um and then you said overrated you said nfts um I think we I think we structured this differently last time we did like companies to watch overrated thing to watch I said overrated with spax I think that was right um I said a company to watch Tara Luna that was way wrong and my crazy prediction was that the book of I will end up richer than Zuck which is you know early like we already talked about okay so this year what do you got for a prediction or predictions for 2023 so we structured it differently but let me say my mine too because they're fast one Elon Musk either dies or he or he gets canceled or he gets canceled in an incredibly like serious way and Tesla stock completely tanks the second thing is so open eye open AI um something involving regulations gonna happen because like there's already been little bits of pieces like if you Google or if you use open Ai and you ask them about coal they say like you know we think that climate change is wrong yada yada or if you ask them about uh race um they say something like you know race is a social and cultural construct and you we don't we don't want to give it our opinion on this like they kind of like but they actually do insert their opinion um and I think that there's gonna be some weird [ __ ] going on where like right now like like for example they'll like say like hey we'll give you a hundred thousand dollars for 10 of your company if you build on top of our platform and there should be all these new tools but it's all going to be underlined with this like potential massive bias that open AI has and I think there's got to be some type of Regulation around it do you know what I mean yeah Andrew what you got predictions and by the way these are supposed to be when we said we said wild predictions so we're again we're not saying we're sure these are going to happen these are like sort of interesting predictions yes you remember like five years ago everyone was saying Apple doesn't innovate anymore they can't do Ai and what was happening is that Google at least historically has innovated in public so they're constantly constantly releasing new features and showing off these kind of half-baked ideas that are in their r d Labs whereas Apple has always been very opaque they'll work on something for seven years they won't share it and then all of a sudden they'll release it and I think that same thing is happening with gpt3 and AI I do believe that while right now I can say I'm using gpt3 instead of Google I think Google has probably been working on something similar for years and years and years and is probably very far ahead maybe not ahead of gpt3 necessarily but that they have their own offering and so I just think it's a those there's going to be a lot of a lot of other players in that space coming out over the next probably three to six months and that it will be there's going to be an ecosystem of offerings similar to AWS and Azure and Google Cloud I think it'll be the same thing with gpt3 Google maybe Microsoft I don't know who else cool um Sam I agree with your Elon one that's one of my predictions I think he gets canceled in a big way or one of his companies goes broke I think that is a a good wild prediction um but I'm actually not going to predict I think that yeah he he's gonna get me too'd I think yeah I feel like he already has and somehow in me already I mean he already did I mean yeah kind of I think he's uncancelable kind of given all this stuff I think people think that and then it's gonna get the number of things still gonna happen I think he's gonna They're Gonna Cancel the uncancelable um but I'm not really going to predict anything that's like the macro because a who the hell knows and B who the hell cares I'm actually going to take a page out of out of the book of uh of something we respect highly here on MFM call on your own shot so my predictions are about myself so here's my here's my predictions about myself uh I predict that this is the year that I get ripped uh I predict that I turned the corner and and not like oh I get back in shape no your boy's never been in this kind of shape so I'm gonna get ripped for the first time and uh I also believe that I'm gonna start a company that is um special I don't I don't want to put a dollar amount because these special things take time so it's not going to happen in one year but I'm gonna do I'm gonna start the thing that will be my kind of like um the thing I'm known for for a very long time the Legacy thing or the thing that you know builds the the big the big wealth the big Empire I think it's gonna happen this year so those are my predictions uh for myself for 2023 well I'm happy you called your shot I actually agree with you I think you're gonna do that too I think you're you're more than likely gonna create that company than you are get ripped but uh you're just giving me that fuel thank you for the fuel are you willing to take drugs to get ripped no I'm all natural you're unwilling to take drugs I like the liver King uh okay well then yeah then I think that you're well dude getting ripped is hard man I'm I'm pretty ripped right now and everyone keeps asking me what I did and you know what I did I just didn't eat and it's really really a pain in the butt I don't really like doing it and so I don't know like I don't think you need to be that ripped what's your definition of ripped I guess visible abs yeah you got to get to what is it 12 body fat 12 it's not you can be you can live a good life and be at 12 but below 10 where I am trying to get it it sucks I'm just hungry and cold yeah I'm not gonna do that but it'll be visible all right um let's do another one uh coolest moment of the year for you what was the coolest moment of the year uh personally that you had dude mine is like it kind of felt like we crossed a Chasm for like kind of like this podcast being well known and like that's a little I didn't want to do a selfish one honestly I almost feel free yeah I almost I wanted to say you selling the milk Road I actually did think that was cool um uh the the seeing you do that I got a lot of joy out of and a lot of like even though I wasn't involved it was like I felt a sense of pride of like we came together the advisor so you know you were involved yeah so feel free to send me some money but uh uh no I think like us getting popular this year like it really felt like this is the first time it happened I agree uh it's something has changed Andrew what about you coolest moment of the year for you so I've talked about this before but I feel like what I actually if I really am honest what I like about business aside from making money and not making my life easier is meeting interesting people and uh you know I got to know uh Andrew huberman this year and we ended up partnering so basically like I've got a foundation I've been giving a bunch of money away to science and so I met huberman maybe is that who you wrote the channel or two ago you wrote the check to science yeah yeah exactly just science but um I met huberman like a year or two ago and basically we did this thing where when people subscribed to his premium podcast a bunch of the money goes to um basically funding science and research that he wants to fund and I basically said look I'll double I'll double every single dollar that you donate and so we've got this partnership and I just love that kind of stuff where would you I can work with some people I respect benefactor do something that I think is good so that's a cool moment you've become a benefactor you get to use one of these words that's like from the 1800s when you do things like that yeah it feels good it's fun dude and plus you have an excuse now to hang out with the dreamiest guy on Earth Andrew huberman yeah totally say I'm jealous anytime you want um for sure all right my coolest moment of the year was you were there for this Sam when we were at Camp MFM and we got to go do a tour of uh of Duke's uh basketball stadium and we're in there and then we uh we're sitting down gave they gave us the talk it was an art it was a good experience at that point but we had a there's a moment that made it a good experience to like a keystone memory which was when I bet Mr Beast ten thousand dollars that I could hit a shot from half court and I hit it and the whole thing on number on number five or something yeah like the third third attempt hit I was like I'll again hit this before you the third attempt I hit it it's on camera it was it was an amazing fun moment it made that that trip a little bit more more special and memorable did he ever pay you this is where it comes this is where it gets interesting it's also actually my biggest L of the year because he didn't pay me and then I had to follow up and I followed up two times three times and now I'm basically begging for the money by the third time you go from like first time you kind of crack it you're busting balls a little bit like hey [ __ ] baby and then the second time you're like hey man uh didn't pay by the time it's the third one now this awesome dope moment has turned into an L because now I'm having to go yeah I think I think I think you need to take him to small claims exactly that's how I'm doing that via iMessage and I was like we have it on video we have the bed up dude we have the bet on video no I know and so this this baller moment of confidence of being like hey betcha 10 grand I can hit the shot and then actually hitting it uh with you know everybody there in the center of you know cameras Cameron Stadium Cameron Indoor Stadium turned into a bit of a small boy moment of being like hey hey um hey did you have a chance to hey just I know you're busy just uh do you think you can I'll send the details again maybe maybe it's on my end dude is he lying about every other uh donation he's ever no coffeezilla get on it are there thousands of victims like me that's crazy I can't believe you didn't pay you he doesn't seem like someone who would he blamed his assistant he's like oh [ __ ] sorry my assistant I'm gonna uh I'm gonna have to yell at him yeah right okay let's do um let's do the craziest most delusional person of the year that we met this one's for for us it's probably easy it's Billy McFarland did you hear that oh did you hear that interview Sean or uh Andrew no I did I didn't hear it I don't like when you guys interview people like that because I I know I know it's like interesting and stuff but I feel like if you if only even if only five percent of people hear that and go hey he actually sounds like a good guy I just think like he's gonna go and [ __ ] more people over I don't know what do you guys think I I didn't and uh we do those bad things he goes and listens to all in instead he doesn't listen to the episode he goes on strike Sean Hall hardly disagrees with you I think yeah I totally disagree I think uh you know this podcast is our vehicle to have conversations with interesting people and everybody's an adult they should judge for themselves whether they think this person's full of [ __ ] or deserves a second chance or whatever on the Pod itself he told us what he was doing and literally with a one pause I just go that's a horrible idea and I actually felt bad that I was that brutal about it uh but it really was I thought a horrible idea and I felt the need to just like say it so um I think it's one thing if you invite them on and they just like like I see this sometimes people just like suck up to people and the other is to be like dude what the hell were you thinking or they're like oh you know I just thought this like are you serious like really you like are you gonna look at me with a straight face and say that this was all just an honest mistake like you had to have known right so I think as long as you are real with your questions uh then it's all good but that's my you know it's my opinion I just think I just think it's like um it's giving air time to people that are bad right like I would say Billy McFarland is probably a psychopath right but the Bernie mate obviously documentary on Netflix coming out in three days are you gonna watch that Bernie Madoff is dead if I if you had if you had Bernie Madoff on your podcast and you were like hey so like what happened tell us your story and even if you kind of call him out if he's like a belief like a real psychopath is like pretty charming and like believable and you listen to them and there's going to be a percentage of people that hear that and the difference with Madoff is he's in jail right the then like Billy McFarland again I have no idea you know he he served his time sure but like he's probably gonna go on and do more sketchy [ __ ] or I don't know any of these people who have a pattern of behavior of doing Psychopathic fraudulent stuff I just don't think they should get any air time frankly yeah okay fair enough I think there's a lot of people who would agree with you uh I don't personally but most most probably do but I actually I'm partially on Sean's side I am mostly on Sean's side but I I do feel guilt sometimes like there's another person who Sean wants to have on that I think there's not a chance we should uh but uh so imagine here's here's how I would tell you to think about this like imagine that you so you know Sam you've told me stories of guys who I remember you told me there was some average Advertiser who is [ __ ] you over and not paying you and you felt very cheated and Sean I mean that guy that you sued who you felt like was chiseling you the landlord or whatever now let's say I have a podcast and I say well there's two sides to every story and he's fascinating I'm gonna go have that guy on my podcast as the victim you'd be like what the [ __ ] that question I would say ask that question as long as you actually ask the questions and you uh you're not just giving them like a chance to lie or say BS in a way that's like it's obviously BS but you let them skate on it um like that's what happened with like Sam bakeries yeah but look at look at Tai Lopez look at Tai Lopez Tai Lopez got legitimized by being on MFM a lot of people heard him and went you know what he's not a bad guy and you know Sam kind of likes him and whatever and like what has he been doing over the last wait wait wait what did I do I didn't do anything you said you're you were like yeah I met him I met him in a hotel and he was actually a really nice guy right and it's like of course he is he's just is charming I like everyone I like to respect the audience and meaning I believe that it you should have the opportunity to hear it and make your own decision I don't pretend that I'm your parent and I'm legitimizing them or I'm telling you they're good or bad or whatever I'm just letting you see them and if you see them and you decide that they're great great if you decide that we didn't ask tough questions and you can't make a decision but Andrew you promote uh you promote Bill Ackman sure like I absolutely do he's my business person and I'm not saying I actually don't know all the details how could you put them in the same category well a lot of I'm not saying I do but a lot of people do don't they Andrew like that's objective you can actually you can at least say that like a lot of people do think that he's uh what did Bill actually do that's on on considered controversy oh yeah what did he do exactly that would be like fraudulent or something like that always made some Investments that have turned out badly but he's never I don't think he's predatory in any way I think Bill is a great individualism I've seen the person you know legitimate is when he went on what's the MLM and he was like I uh the whole markets he basically was like hell is coming blah blah but didn't disclose it he had basically a giant short position yeah maybe caused a panic maybe didn't no but he he had already if he actually look he wrote a letter about this he'd already sold almost his entire position he had like one or two percent left and I spoke to Bill two weeks before that and he was freaking the [ __ ] out like similar benefit greatly if people started selling right he had a giant no sure no he actually made a bunch of money he wasn't no no no no that I think it's a big misunderstanding if you actually look at the Timeline he'd already sold out of that position what about uh Herbalife Herbalife I mean Herbalife he went out and he said this is a multi-level marketing scheme and what ended up happening is the FTC investigated it and they gave them a 200 million dollar fine and they got up to the point of saying hey is this an ml they settled with them for like 200 million it was the largest uh FTC fine ever and Herbalife the FTC commissioner was asked is Herbalife a multi-level marketing pyramid scheme and she said it's not not one right because she was legally Bound by not calling it that so basically bill was right and that was an instance where he lost a shitload of money trying to fight a bad guy did that really happen by the way I'm not saying Bill Ackman sucks I think I'm I'm I like Bill but you're not I know no that's not that's not what I'm applying I'm I'm saying that some people maybe think that he's full of it right I I think yes absolutely there's people that are critical I think there's a great quote on this I'm not saying he is the tallest the tallest blade of grass is the first to get cut and I think Bill is very loud and he is always confident and he's usually right but not always and so someone like that I think when they're not right everyone loves to [ __ ] all over them yeah yeah I'm not saying that I don't think he's in the category where he's got like you know there I don't know of any accusations about stuff like that I think some people are just like he's not as good he loses money he's not as good if an investor as he says or his his Fame would lead you to believe that's a criticism but that's like any that's like that's like criticizing someone's Skittle LeBron James is not as good as Michael Jordan or whatever right like that's different than saying somebody is you know I think it's like it's like fixating on Warren Buffett buying Dexter's shoe and it not working out and then saying or you know Warren Buffett did some deals in his early career where he bought a business and he ended up having to lay a lot of people off right now you could build a narrative that well Warren but everyone says Warren Buffett's so great but what about this and what about this but if you look at it and there's a hundred Investments and 10 of them didn't go well you know you can fixate on the 10 but you can look at the long-term performance bills compounded at 20 plus percent I think 25 or something crazy uh maybe not quite that but something exceptional so again like he's my business partner obviously I'll defend him I'm not by the way yeah I don't think he's anywhere are near those guys I'm not saying I'm not saying I think he sucks I actually like him a lot from what I read about him I'm just saying my point being is a lot of people a lot of awesome people have haters and just because you have a lot of haters doesn't necessarily mean I don't think you should we shouldn't have you on that's my whole point but imagine okay you guys have a newspaper right effectively you guys own the New York Times of tech startup Bros right like that that's what that's what MFM is you guys have this huge audio quote you on that would it be ethical for the editor editor of the New York Times to put an op-ed from Bernie Madoff on the front cover right it was not an op-ed it's an interview it's a big big difference again I hear I totally I totally agree I hear you guys I know you want to like stir the pot and it's good good listening I just for me like I just hate when these weasels get okay let's get back yeah let's move on all right Andrew who's the most delusional person you've met this year so okay so it's a delusional person who I think is amazing um you guys probably will say the same person it's Brian Johnson uh I met Brian almost a year ago and I remember sitting down with him and looking just looking at him he's like a translucent glowing Twilight vampire like he just looks if you cut his arm off there's circuits under there I and he's so incredibly well spoken and like like you I Sam I think you said he's like the the Elon but like behind the scenes and quiet right it's special I think he's amazing uh I think he's like he's like dedicating his life to basically being a test uh you know a test case for the rest of us so I really admire him uh and I think he's really how do you look in person did he look uh on our pot he almost looked he almost looked a little ill like he was so skinny yeah he was so pale that there was no pigment in his skin like literally like literally looked like um what's that movie uh with the [ __ ] what is it uh the robot guy alien alien with the robot guy like just totally pale humanoid that's uh that's my pick too uh Brian Johnson for the for the exact same reason so we'll we'll move to the next one uh he was he was you're right crazy and delusional in the best way possible um yeah as a mean that as a compliment um okay did you guys have another category that you really like your answer for does anybody like think they got something good because we can just go to those the the relationship hacks and the um what you got so um they always say like the best first date is an adrenaline kind of event right so like you want to go on a hike you want to get your heart pounding maybe you go and do like a ropes you know those uh what are they called they're like rope swings through the forest whatever like something that gets your heart pounding because when someone Associates you with a peak experience like a physical feeling of peak experience that's very positive and it bonds you and the same thing is true with alcohol so I I kind of stopped drinking um maybe like seven or eight years ago and I've kind of mourned the ability to go and you know down a pint with someone because they always end up telling you everything they tell you about their business and the problems they're having and you know what's going on with their wife it's like hang out once drunk is like hanging out 10 times times sober and so what I've been doing is I've been been inviting people that I would otherwise have like a meeting with over to my house and we'll do a really long sauna and a cold plunge and I've been finding like I just feel so incredibly bonded to people because I'm having like my body is pumped full of all these endogenous drugs uh and it's been really good it's been kind of like drinking with someone dude can I tell you what mine was here's I'm gonna read let me word re read it word for word invite people have them come over for dinner and cook for them and we take ice baths together after dinner before dinner what are you doing before do you tell them some trucks or how do you prepare are you just spray it on them or or sometimes sometimes they're just spraying on them and I have a towel already and I have shorts and it's so funny that that's exactly what mine is another relationship hack that I have is I bring my wife to almost everything so so it feels like a family a gathering and also she's like like hot and like well like well read and like can have a discussion so it automatically makes me seem better you're the guy with the hot book smart wife oh yeah I bet uh uh yeah so Adrian I had the same thing another thing that I that I typically don't do and I and I think this is the worst way to hang out is while exercising I hate when people say let's go get a workout together I'm like I don't want to I never want to do that ever I will never do a workout and hang out yeah I want silence same I'm the opposite I love love a workout together that's a great it's a great idea I've had multiple listeners from the Pod be like hey I'm in town uh winter workout like I'll just come swing by and we'll just do it together and I was like oh that's perfect I don't want to separately beat you and uh I'll learn so much about you just seeing how you work out that this is uh like how you deal with like you know adversity like you know how you're how are you as a hang you know do you work out like all these things it's a great tell all right I got two little hacks the first is a principle that I've had for a long time it's called don't attend the party host the party this is my um I have a rule I don't attend other people's events typically unless it's a real good friend who really wants me to but I will host so um I think hosting is it is let's say five times the work but I think it's 500 times the payoff uh when you actually host the the event so we uh Camp MFM is a perfect example of this uh and when you host it um the other the other hack in this is make it epic because it's going to be more fun for you to it's like all the logistical work is kind of the same but if you just use your creativity to make it a more interesting people will come and they'll have like a whole memory to you know a whole experience uh with you so with Camp MFM the way we did it where we flew to this place we had the basketball trainer Mr Beast and Hassan were there like interesting people were there we all stayed in you know an Airbnb a giant house together like that was a instead of just doing a networking event we made it fun and we made it different and I think I know you get a bunch of benefits of being the one who hosted it that's the first one the second one I would say the actual relationship hack with with my wife is so I'm a pretty chill dude but I do I do have one Achilles heel which is I'm very very very impatient and what that means is like you know my wife is like slow to leave the house trying to go somewhere it's like oh dude why does this take so I feel like I've wasted half my life waiting to leave the house um you know just with kids it gets like really slow so I've always had this impatience thing and I've tried to be like all right I'm gonna be more patient I'm gonna be more patient and I realized that that was actually a Fool's errand that the way to be more patient for me is to get in a fight in the morning and what I started doing was I hired this MMA trainer and I would wake up early I do my workout in the morning and I would Spar and what I found is that if I Spar in the morning I've gotten a really hard strenuous like endorphin kick you know done the rest of the day I'm just sort of like yo it's whatever like I I can wait yeah you can take take an extra 10 minutes uh you want to change your shirt because maybe this one's a little maybe a little too hot it's like go ahead go change your shirt yeah no problem I'll be here at the front door chilling and I have become such a more patient person just by doing a sparring session in the morning it's a pretty extreme step to take but it is so far the only thing that has gotten me to change this like really terrible personality trait after so long nothing like getting punched in the face I was I I think I told you that you did tell me that and the other experience I had like this was I've been skydiving once in the morning and the rest of the day you could stress me out if you tried I was in I was a completely immune to stress and so I think there's something to this like having a very exhilarating or adrenaline kick in the morning it just makes the rest of the day completely non-stressful that doesn't mean you don't do anything it just means you don't stress we were talking about the cold plunges and um I was just listening to a huberman lab and he was talking about this exact thing so when you're in cold it obviously stresses your body you get a huge dopamine Spike and you get adrenaline norepinephrine all that kind of stuff and he was saying that if you do stressful things while you're in the cold plunge it adapts you to dealing with stress better so you should definitely get a cold plunge and then argue with your wife while you're in it or something sounds smart uh so that's best religion pack what's the what was the other one you said uh oh favorite tool or product under what it's favorite uh tool or product under a thousand dollars what you guys got so I always have this problem um I'll travel to a city and I'll try and think of you know I'll be like okay I'm going to New York on this day who do I know in New York and it'll be whoever's top of Mind whoever I've just been texting with or something and I'll go and I'll have a couple meetings and then I'll leave and then I'll remember you know it's like when you leave the grocery store and you realize there's like three or four important things you forgot I always realize oh [ __ ] I forgot to meet all these people I really wanted to see and so um I've tried a couple different tools for this but I found one I really liked it's this one called clay it's a personal CRM which we all hate I know it's like a horrible business but um they do a really good job of basically tapping into your Twitter your LinkedIn your iMessage all the pla your email all the places where you contact me and this is uh Earth clay.earth yeah and so basically it's a huge database of all the people you know and so what I do now is I go in clay and I'll just be like I'll type in New York and it'll show me everyone in New York and then I don't miss people uh and that's been huge this is a beautiful website yeah I turn right away because it helps us like uh same problem with all crms for me where like you get out what you put in and I'm just not willing to put it put it enough but there's no I don't use it like I don't you I don't update it it's just when I go traveling it's just a database of people I know and where they live can I uh mine is my body tutor and I don't know if Sean that if that's yours as well but have you heard about my body tutor Andrew no very simple all right here's what it is I spent 600 a month and every day my coach her name's Heather calls me and says what are you gonna eat today and I tell her and she's those yesterday according to your MyFitnessPal you ate this this and this this thing was bad how'd that make you feel and I say I feel horrible I'm not going to do it again today and she just shames me or educates me on why I made a good or bad decision and we like work backwards from whichever goal I want it's it's a five minute phone call uh that's been the bit the best tool I've ever used that's a good one that's all it is I um so I'm a pretty disorganized guy so my favorite tools or products have been the one that helped me get organized and I got two that kind of save my ass this year um I don't know Sam did you when you were at the hustle did you ever have like a bookkeeper yes and do you remember life before a bookkeeper and a life after bookkeeper before it's stressful and like now I know that like I didn't know what the difference between revenue and cash flow was and I didn't like understand like that like you take expenses and you like I'm amortize them I didn't understand all that stuff so it was as if I was driving at night time without headlights on the perfect way to describe it that's how I've been my whole life and I would always wonder man how do these other people have their [ __ ] together how is it you know tax season comes around I'm just like scrambling and it's like the worst version of cramming for a test and so this year I basically totally revamp my financial like hygiene game with a bookkeeper and a tax person that I love and I'm gonna shout them both out because they're amazing uh they were they were so amazing I did invest in both of the companies because I was like I have to like you know I I believe in this uh you know because they saved my ass so one is called Kick so I think it's kick.co is the URL and it's basically if you go to the website I like their tagline it says self-driving bookkeeping so basically what they do is they just say connect your bank your credit cards and it's like everything it's like your Amazon you just click connect connect connect boom it's all your books and then they have bookkeeper and she calls me and she's like here's how you're doing like here's how you're pacing here's what you know here's some things you should be thinking about here's how we can save you money um you know blah blah blah and not like not like spend less but more like tax wise like here's some things that you could do and so bookkeeping was the first one uh and then how much is this all my books are together it's super cheap it's like I don't know it's like 99 or 100 199 a month or something like that it's like if anybody if you're a Creator like the one big thing is they they do this for like kind of like small small businesses like sort of like LLC types s Corps or um creators so like if you're a YouTuber or twitch Creator or a podcaster uh most of them have don't treat their creator business like a business and you totally should it is a business and I think also the law has now changed so starting next year I think they have to do like the quarterly estimated taxes and things like that like dude 99 of the creators have no idea what this stuff is or how to do it and so um so I love this thing this has been like kind of a game changer for me out of having my my p l my cash flow my balance sheet all of it just like very clean and then then that gets handed to the other service gelt and so but guilt does is kind of amazing I don't know how much of this I'm supposed to say are allowed to say it I don't even think they want me shouting it out because it's like dude I just signed it I just signed up I just signed up with gel uh are you on the waitlist are you you actually started using it I dm'd him and I have a call set up so the guy tal is this incredible guy he's an entrepreneur so but for the best thing so I've I've met many I've had many like kind of accountants and Tech strategy people and I literally walked in and I felt like I was walking into a meeting like you know with CIA or something like that with IRS it's like and and Nick Hoover said this right he goes yeah dude 95 of accountants and tax strategy people they're like they act like government agents and he's like you can't even he's like you're just asking questions like how should I structure this differently in order to and they can't answer it's like they're not creative first of all so they're not even giving you ideas it's like if you have the idea they can say yes or no but it's like dude where am I supposed to come up with all these ideas from uh so like they don't give you ideas first of all and secondly they're like well did you spend more than 22 hours doing this it's like dude I don't know I wasn't keeping track of that but like if I say yes what happens if I say no what happens I need to understand like could you just disarm this it's not even like help me cheat it's like literally just don't make this stressful it's been my big problem with this and so guilt is kind of amazing because towels he's a Founder he's an entrepreneur he sold his last company and he's like dude I just like he's like personally I just hated taxes and so I decided to create like the tax firm I wish existed and they're amazing so the same thing they take your books and then what they do is they're more like yo have you thought about structuring your corporations in this way because then you can get the advantage of qsbs while still maintaining this advantage and like they they do everything clean they do everything by the book but they are they feel more like your friend helping you do this than the other way and so these guys probably save me I don't know I don't know how much to save me but I wouldn't be surprised if it was seven figures of what I've saved using this thing um and it's the first time I've been not stressed on the subject of finding like bookkeeping and taxes and so like that has been like a very nice feeling for me to have versus like this scramble and always feeling like there was some adult class that I missed I slept through and now here's the test like that's how that's how taxes always felt for me was I slept through the class and everybody else took it everybody else is prepared and I don't know what the [ __ ] I'm doing and now finally I feel like okay I I have my notes to take this test dude I think it's one of the one of those things that's shocking how many business people just don't know how to read a balance sheet and a p l and cash flow statement and it's if you want to learn Khan Academy has an amazing introductory course takes about an hour and you'll learn everything you need to do you guys hear this the IRS hired like some like some absurd number of new Auditors was it like 18 000 if you're like 80 000 or or more I don't know like IRS hiring new agents I think they hired 80 000 um 87 000 new hires and so I think there's gonna be a [ __ ] little audit which is why I wanted to be like super buttoned up with everything um just because oh man that's another time suck if you get audited of like dealing with all that crap so uh you know I don't think they hire these people to do nothing it's 80 billion 80 billion in new funding and 87 000 tax agents isn't that insane that's [ __ ] crazy they're gonna have a lot of work to cut out for them um I think we should almost wrap up we have we want to do one one or two yeah let's do one or two more what are your favorite ones yeah let's do let's do one what's a really good one what about biggest change adjustment you're making yeah I have one go Sam so um for I have a new thing that I'll launch that it's live but I'll announce it later um I'm hiring a CEO for it I've already like done that and I've never done that early on I also am doing close to like I'm being less of a dictator and I'm also being less metrics driven this sounds like the freaking douchiest thing ever but I'll say it but more like Vibe and energy driven uh basically with the hustle and like my last company I was like by the book where it was like all right I want to see projections we're going to nail it we're gonna like the metrics say this therefore like I can see you putting a metric on the vibe too like we're in 87 on five this week guys well like on my last like for all my companies I'm like look you've got to do this many outbound calls like we're gonna like whatever the a b metric is this is what it is uh like we're going with a that A1 and I just filed the data and I was like I don't care and then it was very much a dictatorship where I said my rule or my way or the highway and I'm trying to be a little bit calmer for my next thing and I think I'll make way more money that way that's a great one great adjustment uh Andrew what you got biggest change or adjustment you're making in your business life 2023 so last year I don't know if I said this but my big goal was conquering email like I just I was overwhelmed by it it was stressing me out and so now I've built a system I've fully delegated it I've got someone dedicated to managing my email and so I really only get 10 or 15 emails that I have to respond to and everything else is triaged and responded to and dealt with so I've conquered email the problem is now I get a lot of iMessages like texts and stuff and I'm going I don't know how to conquer that other than changing my number which seems [ __ ] up um I'm trying to figure that out if anyone has any ideas please tweet at me because um there's it seems like there's no way if someone has your number they're going to get to you and I have a really hard time not responding to text I feel kind of guilty um so I'd love to hear you're just getting like cold texts from strangers is that the problem dude I get so many of those not that it's just there's I mean I get cold text for sure but it's more just like there's so many people I've given my number out to and if someone doesn't get an email response to me sometimes they'll try and go there I think like some people have found my number online like it's just it's just becoming too much and I'll be like with email you can kind of turn it off I'll be putting my kids down for bed and like reading a Kindle book on my phone and I'll be getting hit up with text and it's just the ability to break into your Consciousness would you just get a new number sucks yeah I was thinking about it but I've had my number since I was like 15. it feels messed up to do I know but I've thought about doing that as well Sam uh okay so you did yours Andrew you did yours my biggest adjustment um you knowing when to use my impulsiveness so I am an extremely impulsive person um and that works in like eight out of ten situations one of the situations it doesn't work in is I'm very impulsive with picking businesses to start and yeah I will just like start a business like instantaneously and I will go and I'll start making it happen and it's really fun and that wave and that Thrill is so addictive and then 11 months later I'm like okay now I have this business um was this the business that I wanted to have was because like I can't do that many of these at the same time uh so is this the right are you happy you started your Ecom thing um no if I could go back and just pick a different project I would um same thing with the milk Road part of the reason I sold it was I was like I don't think this was the project that I want to work on every year um you know for the next three years and so if I don't want to work on it for the next three years I should just sell it now and like you know uh if I have a good offer like take it um but that's kind of a shitty feeling like there's a celebration in selling but there's also a bit of a failure it's like I've been saying this for a while I want to work on a project that I don't want to sell like this podcast time has flown by where this is the third year we're doing the Millie awards that means this Friday is at least three years old um I can keep going I would do this for free I was doing this for free I was going to do this at a loss so this is the right type of project for me to do it's one that I would literally do if there was no money involved I don't count the days or the hours I'm not stressed about the metrics I know it's going to keep going up because we'll just keep trying to do a better and better job I have fun doing it and it's not a not a drag on my lifestyle right like perfect project this has been the only project I've selected correctly on I would argue every single business I've started since the age of 21 was the wrong pick and it was always just the impulsive pick it was someone should do this dude I bet I could do that dude I would just do this as this all right let me just do it and I would just do it and then you know sure enough I'm look looking for the exit later because it wasn't really the right project so I'm trying to find the big changes I'm going to find the project that's in my zone of Genius um that is the perfect project for me it's what I enjoy doing um and I'm not building it for some future payoff I'm building it I'm doing it because I like doing it that it is the the project that's you know I'm most interested in and if that changes later okay that's fine I'm not saying I have to do it till I'm 99 years old but um I'm not doing it just kind of like on a whim so I'm going to be patient and select the project properly that's good it's about time I've been telling you that for 10 years the best lessons are the ones that you have to relearn 10 10 times over okay so the other one was best business idea yeah do you guys dude yeah let's end up tell me why your washer and your dryer are two different machines remember to put my wet clothes into the dryer it's ridiculous this needs to be one that's honestly that is one of the smartest actually a really good point it's it's crazy to me it's crazy to me that it's two different things that that actually exists no it's in it's in Best Buy Home Depot they're not that great it's a thing they're not that great yet like I use them in Europe and they're only okay but they need to be the norm this needs to be the norm yeah yeah if you're working on AI or crypto or self-driving cars quit and figure this one out like we gotta put we gotta have our priorities in order you know how many people are wasting time dude like it's like look at James Dyson look at James Dyson he's worth 18 billion dollars and he just was like vacuums are terrible I'm gonna rethink those I mean he could have been working on AI but no you chose something prior machine next to our dishwasher machine thank you I agree dude like some of the or like uh or like have you ever noticed how the inside of a refrigerator no matter how rich you are it always looks like [ __ ] like we need like a better organizer or something for like so some of these like day-to-day problems I think need to be improved particularly we'll start with the washer and dryer it needs to be one machine okay I like that one Andrew um so mine I tweeted about this um so there's all these private jets out there flying around all over the world and uh tell me about it um people people will people will fly somewhere and they don't need a return flight or they're gonna go there for two weeks or three weeks or whatever and so the plane actually flies back empty just with the pilots on it right and I think this is truly insane this is like billions of dollars getting lit on fire every month of just jet fuel and empty planes and stuff I don't know what the solution is I know there's people that have tried this um but it seems like a incredibly inefficient disjointed uh world and someone needs to crack this and create a central database of basically every plane that's available because let's think about who owns private jets it's very very rich people very rich people are usually business people and are logical do they care about having someone else fly back if it pays for all the fuel and stuff probably not maybe like Gucci where it's like well I don't want to like sell my unsold Gucci clothes I'd rather just burn them to keep the value up sure yeah I don't know maybe but anyway I do think there's a lot of people who would certainly uh want to get compensated for that if it was easy and I think someone needs to crack this yeah that's a that's a good one um okay I'm gonna go with the school for the starving artist okay so I've met a lot of people in life who like to do different artsy things you know photography film uh you know met somebody who was like you know they like they're like oh yeah I fell in love with photography because I would hang up the freaking prints and like let them dry like whatever you know whatever that [ __ ] is uh you know coloring you know blah blah drawing there's all these aren't artistic things and I would say most people give up on those passions or things because it's really really hard to make a living doing it or is it that's what I want to answer because now that I'm doing this Ecom thing I now pay a lot of money to photographers it's just that they had to be branded as photographers who understand how to do product photography or commercial photo shoots um my wife when she was in business school was just doodling on her paper board and somebody walked by and luckily they saw that and they go did you draw that and she was like oh yeah sorry uh I'm paying attention I promise he's like no no I don't care like but if you can draw that I have a job for you it's called graphic facilitation you can make a thousand dollars a day just by going to these meetings and conferences for these businesses and you draw on a giant whiteboard what they're talking about so they have a visual takeaway at the end of it and she made more money than me for a long time doing this thing she would have never known how to turn her art into money and so I think somebody should create an art school for people who have artistic talents but want to be rich uh for have our discounts but they want to make a living doing it and not just be a starving artist for their whole life I think you should create a specific school for this and all the courses are things where you take an artistic trait but you teach them how to do it in the commercial way and they can make money even while they're in school doing this like you know how big of a shortage there is of video editors now that YouTube and Tick Tock are so huge or you know again commercial photography or drawing or all these different different uh artistic things so I think somebody should create the school for The Starving Artists where they're no they're not going to starve anymore and uh get the get the artists that are willing to sell out like 25 and just like do this like you see this girl on Tick Tock she does these she'll take like a uh like Dr Pepper will pay her like a million dollars to this Tick Tock where she does these like crazy slo-mo zoom in water dripping on the side and she makes this epic like like video trailer of a Dr Pepper she makes a Dr Pepper look like it's the unveiling of a new you know rocket by SpaceX and she's just really talented at that and brands are willing to pay her for that type of marketing yeah there's a lot of people out there who could do that they just didn't connect the dots well what are you gonna call it you gotta have some cute ass names don't have it yet that's the only whole that's the only hold up I'm not gonna I'm not gonna start until I have the perfect name you know me do we uh Andrew you look like you just got your first communion uh you just like you you have you haven't an Angelic face and an Angelic look it doesn't matter how rich and successful you become you uh you still look like this little perfect communion boy thank you I'm working on becoming a Twilight vampire like uh Brian that's my other goal this year what's the thing he eats every morning the piggy pudding or whatever yeah nutty pudding that's your face looks more trim oh thank you I feel like you say that every time I come on just like a crazy tan have you just ever come back like in Puerto Rican um my problem is I I tan really really well on my arms and face but I'm like I cannot Tan on my body so I have a have you ever done a favor have you tried taking off your shirt uh no this is yeah sure I should do that yeah and I want you to look like you know Ricky Martin so you know just like you need to come back at least like a third Colombian in your tan next year next time okay here's here's the deal here's the deal okay you and I'm serious you get to uh eight percent body fat I will go to a tanning salon I will go in one of those stand-up Tanners and I will uh I will get really tanned and come on you got a deal okay well no no it's crazy 12 12 is like 12 is like soft ABS I want like crazy shreds he'll look shredded because he's dark for like 12 minutes I'm gonna have to like sacrifice my life to do this I think 12 is a more than fair deal okay this is a deal what's the what's the timeline within the year whenever I do it this is a lifelong bet if I ever get there if I ever send you a picture Sam we should we got to talk about that Meetup we're doing in Vancouver I will we'll do a shout out next time at the beginning but we'll also do it now so we're doing a meet-up Sean obviously you're invited but I don't ever I doubt you'll ever you

that's pretty cool I'll go I'll I'll do it you got people there's people on it you want to come yeah come it'd be awesome I think sahil said he would come too and I just followed up with him on

a date all right guys well another successful Millie Awards of the books thank you and we will see you next year ", "word_count": 24131}, {"video_id": "vz0vt0_hdv4&t=3191s", "transcript": "most internet entrepreneurs when they get into starting businesses they do things that are either black hat or gray hat and then they realize I gotta do things legit because I don't want to go to jail and I can make more money doing things ethically and not breaking the law like you just like make so much more money being legit how on Earth did you not learn that lesson earlier all right today's pod is interesting we just had Billy McFarlane and he's famous for the fire festival thing which basically was this like huge Coachella type event that went viral four years ago and he ended up committing a ton of crimes that he admitted to and was a charged and convicted of like 25 or 30 million dollars worth of fraud we just had him on the Pod very confusing pod Sean I think not confusing but but like mixed emotions yeah yeah I mean he's an interesting guy he's also uh complicated like most people and uh you know I don't know I think we I think it was pretty interesting we talked about a bunch of things we talked about kind of his origin story how he got to the fire festival and almost like where it all went wrong so where did he start making you know mistakes and then eventually committing crimes uh we talked about life in prison and what that was like in solitary confinement and things like that we talked about what he's doing now how he's trying to come back and me and Sam are a little bit hard on his new idea I would say well to the point of if this was a normal if this was just a normal person random person on the street I would not have been as harsh but I felt like I I don't know for whatever reason I felt like I had the license to be a little harsh on this one um we talked about that yeah we talked about other ideas about what he could do or other opportun business opportunities he sees uh pretty fascinating guy very fascinating guy the thing that like that sits bad with me is or it makes me confuses he's very likable he's a very likable person incredibly Charming very charismatic and I want him to win but he did a lot of really bad [ __ ] and he seems a little a little coached in the sense that he's like right up front we'll say uh what I did was terrible I deserve no sympathy uh you know I was wrong and I was an idiot right and he's very quick to kind of own that which is great you'd want somebody to own it but it's also I think that's somebody who who understands okay this is the message I gotta stay on this message and um yeah I gotta make it really clear where I stand on that it's like when you have like a star football player a star athlete in high school and you see them like doing bad [ __ ] off the field and you're like dude you have it all man you've got the talent please don't blow this it it hurts us all to see someone with so many gifts do such bad [ __ ] and that's a little bit how I felt with this and uh yeah I'm I say this in the end but I'm eager to see how this story ends I'm gonna be following it and I think it was a good pod uh Ben our producer Ben thought uh it went great he was messaging US during it but I uh I think people will like it yep all right enjoy all right let's just get right into this so it sounds like you have like staff like you just asked someone to get you a coffee so are you like are you back I mean you're you're you're in the mix again you're working yeah broke as hell but uh taking advantage of you know anybody I can get to help me try to rebuild and start making things right and do you have like a crazy restitution thing so we should explain kind of what the so this is Billy Billy created fire Festival most notably you may have seen I don't know the documentaries or whatever you just got out of prison but one of the things that's associated with it is you have like more than 20 million or something that you have to pay back in restitution to some combination of investors uh creditors people like that how does that work you do you have to give them like every dollar or is it a certain percentage like how does that work because that's a deep deep hole yeah and it's brutal I'm like I just can't think about that big number because then you know I'll sort of lose track about like what's happening today and tomorrow so how it works is that I have to pay a percentage of all of my personal income you know directly back to restitution like after taxes they calculated on just like gross income so totally pre-tax income so make like a thousand dollars this week I have a set percentage I have to pay on that thousand dollars but what is in addition to that yeah what's the percent is it like crazy or is it like five percent it's more than five I'm not sure like where it's gonna end up it varies based on income so I know what I have to pay right now but I think it gets readjusted every couple of months and then in addition to that pirates giving 10 of all of its Revenue back to restitution as well so if pirate gets 100K sponsorship deal like it'll pay 10K right away and then whatever I get as my like salary or income I'll pay an additional percentage on top of that so I'm just trying to pay more than I have to why are you doing this right now why are you I mean like you know you're in a different situation I I firmly believe that I I listen to your pot the pods that you've done I've watched the documentary I've read a little bit like you made a massive mistake so yeah I think that you you you deserved to be punished and so I don't feel sorry for that for I don't feel sorry for you for having to do that I think five years or four years however much you serve that's that's a lot so my my current stance is like everyone deserves a second chance and if you if you do the crime and you have to do the time like you you there should be a point where it's like all right you screwed up you get it you can try again I feel that but when I see you doing this podcast push right now I'm like should we is he taking advantage of us like why is this guy doing this right now why is he what what is he gonna was he trying to sell or or is this therapeutic or are you just trying to make a living which well you know what what's your what's your motivation between this recent push yeah so like first of all totally deserved what I got and sorry I think there's like days where I felt like I got too much time there's days where I felt like I didn't get enough just like based on everything else happening in the world so deserved it was coming and like definitely not looking for sympathy I think there's two things here one is that by doing these podcasts I'm getting great like inbound deal flow so if three or four companies are listening to this and they're like oh wait he actually does know how to Market he can get us attention and they'll come and hire me like that's amazing that's my entire purpose of like doing this small media run right now I think it's like looking at your Twitter comments a little bit this morning before I came on the show a lot of people and other hosts have gotten the same feedback is like why the hell would you give a con artist like any time of day um love your loved your response but I think the response to all those people is like what did I say you said like maybe an interesting conversation that will get us money transparency I said I said uh an interesting person or a cure an interesting person that would have an interesting conversation and it will get us a lot of views uh I think that's cool like other people haven't been able to say that so I think that's great but I think to them is that anybody who has taken life to the extreme or too far has learned like a lot of good and bad lessons from that so like they can use me right and if there's like one entrepreneur here who's trying to raise money and he or she thinks like [ __ ] this is a little harder than I thought 60 days ago and they're about to send out that monthly investor update don't [ __ ] up your numbers like Don't Go Over the Top to to raise that cash and like if I can stop one person really cool but on the other end of the spectrum if there's somebody who's going about it honestly and they're scared to kind of take that leap like if I could Inspire them to go and try to make their brand pop off really cool as well so I think there's lessons to be learned and people could kind of use all of my mistakes to help them wherever they are in their entrepreneurial journey and you you are kind of a hustler so you um uh we'll kind of Go Fast through it but you basically when you're in middle school started creating projects I don't even want to say company because like you know I don't know how much of a company it is when you're in middle school but like you were building products and uh launching them as websites that's right is that right like in Middle School yeah just basically started doing super basic HTML CSS in like fifth and sixth grade and so this is what 20 21 22 years ago and it was pretty much like the Wild Wild West days of the internet and started a couple of like web hosting companies and basic social networks and that was really my foray into the world of Entrepreneurship and technology so you you make those sites you end up selling them or you sold at least one of them uh for like what like uh a big way and a small win what would you do when you were kind of like you're probably 2006 and seventh grade yeah yeah these are a couple thousands of dollars so life-changing to you know okay just wants to buy candy but and at this point kind of irrelevant but I think like kind of got me into the game um started a little bit of a bigger media site called 24 scene in high school and sold that 2014 yes sell it to a company called buddy TV out of Seattle when I was 16. what did that do what was 24c it was a Content Network and I love the TV show 20 for so was basically clipping you know Snippets of the 24 show and this is before streaming so it's hard 24. yeah exactly so it's hard to get like actual media of the shows this is all based on like you know Fox like aired it and then it really was very little media afterwards so I was taking like the show that aired and clipping it up and ended up doing it for a half a dozen TV shows and I had this business partner at the time who was in his mid-30s in Michigan but I never met and he like orchestrated the sale and then he paid me out on Western Union every two weeks for like the remainder of my high school so that was pretty crazy how much did you how much you make doing that it was like tens of thousands of dollars like but at the time it was it was wild for me and from there is you you went to school and you you graduated but you never had a real job did you went to college um basically started living off of my 2014 Capital under this little suitcase under my bed for my freshman year of college and for the first time I started going out like going to nightclubs going to dinners like exploring what every 18 year old I think man like wants to see what's out there in the world and flew all my cash in a couple of months so I'm like [ __ ] now I'm broke sitting in my college in this like small town I can't afford to like try to find a car to take me to New York City anymore like what can I do so got back to what I knew which was basic programming and started a social networking website called spling during my freshman year of college and that introduced me this entire world of like venture capital and Angel Investing and essentially dropped out of school halfway-ish through my freshman year to work on spling and then I started this whole like run of venture capital backed startups my um my wife uh through friends of friends somehow uh had some run-ins with you at Penn like like apparently like good running or you know someone you must have dated someone who were friends of someone and she and she uh they would tell me stories about uh they're like yeah we knew him and he would always rent like these fat cars and drive us all and pay for everything to go to New York City from Philly uh and like he we just thought like he just had some business and no one knew what it was no it wasn't anything inappropriate but it was just like he just like just we all do it's this guy who must have had some money through some internet companies and he uh he treated on all of us on a regular basis yes I went to went to Philly for a company called dream Adventures which is kind of like this accelerator incubator program and it was dating a girl at the time who was I think it's a sophomore now at Penn so I should have been a sophomore in school so all my like peers and friends were in college and like so I'd be like at dream it trying to raise money by day and then like at the terrible like college parties by night and then obviously trying to take them to New York so what what triggered this switch from like uh I'm a kid programmer who likes to make hobbyist websites like you know scenes from my favorite TV show 24 to like I'm trying to be the man because it seems like at some point you all your business ventures switched to like things that were super cool right you did the Black Card credit card thing uh you did fire obviously which was like you know the next Coachella so at some point you switched from like kind of hobbyist websites to how do I be the cool guy you know the Big Man on Campus type of thing what what triggered that that switch for you yeah I think that's a good question and it was almost like I was living these alternative lifes and not really fitting in with either one I was a college kid but trying to raise money from Venture capitalists when you know at my little school the majority of the students haven't heard of the word like venture capital in their life and then so I'd go hang out with these Venture capitalists who were Titans of industry or you know successful Angel Investors and kind of go back to the college realm so I was always kind of interested in merging the Two Worlds so when I'm hanging out with the VCS the college kids all want access to this and they would hire me to help like Market or consult so it was kind of hustling and trying to make side income to to fund a lifestyle and trying to kind of keep up with this new world that my basic programming had been giving me access to and then at what point so the was like your first kind of it wasn't a real win like you didn't exit but you raised I think four or six million dollars was that the the magnet is it called magnesis yes so um turn 19 graduated from the dream Adventures moved spling to the second ever we work labs uh down on Barrack Street in New York and I was there we were now around he's like 30-ish you know hustling entrepreneurs all trying to make it I'm a kid and went out to dinner with just like a group of these friends I was starting to meet in New York who are a little bit older a little bit more established and one of them pulls out this black American Express Centurion card and kind of slams it on the table to show off and I'm like [ __ ] I have 40 in my Chase account like how how can I do this so I went back to my wework office went online to Alibaba before Alibaba was really like a mainstream thing uh particularly like in New York in the US bought these black metal cards and bought a Credit Card Copier they kind of came in the mail took my Chase blue debit card copied it onto this black card went to the pizza place across the street from the wework guy was treating me like I was royalty went back into the office and just saw these cards to all the entrepreneurs in the wework office and then magnesis was born and how big did that business get before it uh before it went South so my nieces did Total like 11 12-ish million in Revenue over three years and my biggest mistake was getting distracted by fire in the fire festival and I understand this is forwarding like years in advance but in the run-up to fire festival for the four or five months I just started trying to get money from anywhere and everywhere and basically milked the magnus's customer base as much as I could and then when fire crashed Magnus went down with it so I'm just not seeing it through was such a [ __ ] up but magnesis was just it was just literally like it's not a bank account it was just literally the physical card as well as some perks like you would get like discounts to certain concerts I guess is where fire kind of got inspiration from yes discounts to certain clubs I guess or like a discount for like a private jet service so you just must have negotiated the deals or probably even white labels like some other company that had found cool deals and knew for 300 you got the sick uh card like literally physically just a card with your same bank account you had access to like a townhouse I forget what you called it a townhouse uh and you got to go to some parties and you got some perks is that basically the model exactly then what was really interesting though was the members were bringing all the perks and benefits so initially I sold these cards and so now let's say we sold a couple hundred cards I'm like wow Our member base is super interesting whether they're entrepreneurs they're people all these different industries that my friends don't really have access to like let's get a space where they can all come and connect so I went and rented a series of Lofts and townhouse that I couldn't afford where basically members can come and hang out anytime and then as magnesis grew we just built an app where members would come to us saying hey I work at this brand whether it's like this plane company this Fitness Studio this fashion brand let's do something special for the rest of the members and they would basically pay us to advertise and give access to cool [ __ ] to the members and the members of pay us an annual fee to get access to these perks it was kind of interesting we're making money from both sides and then relying on the actual member base to create the offering was it profitable so I was just so bad with financial management that we raised you know a few million bucks for magnesis but we never had more than two months of runway in the entire history of the company so I'd raised around and like 80 of that round was already spent in terms of like Bill's owed to employees contractors agencies whatever so it's like always a kiss to death like okay raise a million bucks but [ __ ] I owe 800 Grand and now we have two months to run my left I think my biggest inability was to communicate like that problem to investors I just kept saying like things are great you know you'll raise a million bucks and we're off for the races I couldn't just like really explain how much we needed and why we needed it and that caused us to have to basically become profitable super early on so just started monetizing the user base way more than I should have which I think diminished the value of the brand and for like the last year and a half two years of magnesium it's like we weren't profitable but we were paying all of our bills just based on Revenue we just like tried to monetize too quickly and too fast to keep up with my like crazy expenses but even magnesius magnesis had issues like there's like stories of like you know the the members saying we thought we were buying tickets to blank but turns out like we didn't actually have them or maybe like Hamilton tickets I think there's a story around that like you even had issues then what what uh uh what what were the what were those issues so when fire Festival came and I started going down this terrible Rabbit Hole I needed money from everywhere and anywhere and that included overselling and trying to over promise things to magnesis members to get that capital and it just like took everything down and like I was wrong and I was like lying everywhere thinking I could make these miracles happen and sometimes we did but more often than not we we crashed and burned at the end so it just like totally just like lost track of all the good that was happening and I know you you feel bad and you probably feel you know some shame and all these negative things do you ever just laugh at like wow what the hell like what did I do where did this go how great how far did this thing go it's like there's a reason there's documentaries about it it's literally like a movie is there any part of you that just sort of looks at this and says I can't believe how far I let this thing go and how far it went totally and like I was like looking and trying to think through the SPF scenario you know for the past couple of weeks and I think at the end of the day like he's obviously in a completely different Stratosphere but it's really in his position it's really hard to say no to someone with 10 billion dollars right I don't care like how smart or how wealthy you are so much of our decision-making process is based on social proof and when you meet someone with that kind of capital it immediately checks off all these like subconscious boxes that create this phenomenon on social proof and I think that like to a much larger scale that's what happened to him but it also happened to me where I had thousands of customers or thousands of members and all these talent and artists who are promoting the brand and I was in a position where I was just like way too young way too immature and people who should have helped me were almost scared to say no and I kind of like relished and thrived off of that and this led me down this terrible terrible rabbit hole and when they started saying no I was too like in my own head where oh you know I pulled pulled this off and proved you wrong before I just like didn't know how to press that red button to stop and that was like one of my biggest issues I think the reason you're interesting because every entrepreneur we have a lot of I mean people who like listen to this Potter like entrepreneurial and everyone like most internet entrepreneurs when they get into starting businesses they do things that are either black hat or gray hat and then they realize they realize like okay this is sick I know how to make money like I'm proficient at this skill set but like I gotta do things legit because I'm gonna make way more money if I and I do the same thing I used to do these like I mean I've done criminal [ __ ] as well and I'm like what the hell am I thinking I should do things the right way because I don't want to go to jail and I can make more money doing things ethically and not breaking the law like you just like make so much more money being legit how on Earth did you not learn that lesson earlier I think just craziest thing is I didn't know really what failure was until I failed on such a massive scale um I think part of what let me go so far is I obviously had as many losses if not more than every other entrepreneur along the journey but I was really good or I guess really bad at blocking out that noise and I was so focused on like this end goal of Nothing Else Matters like let me put my blinders on just like keep running forward and I just kept getting jaded to failures until the failure became so big that I'm I'm locked in solitary confinement and what was the end goal like for for me it's like I want to make a certain amount of money so I could have a certain house so I don't have to worry anymore so I could spend my monthly however much I want and then there's there's I me and I mean all of us have some ego thing of like I want to prove to people that I'm Legit yeah um what what was your but I like had a certain money goal in mind I imagine Sean's the same way he's like well I want this lifestyle I want this what what what's your motivating factor in all this like and you say I want to have a 100 million dollars a net worth by a certain age or I want girls to have sex with me which is like we all obviously do like what's like the motivating factor I want to fit in I think I I had two big like insecurities and drives one is those initial investors who backed me when I was 18. I wanted to prove to them that they were right and fire was seven years later from that 70 years later after that so one I want to prove they were right I was too insecure to show any kinks to my armor to them and two is I wanted to be the guy that just like took you to wild crazy experiences and I'm like wow like this whole programming thing is taking me into this world of entertainment I'm hanging out with Like Rappers and models and Comedians and my friends don't believe me like I want to be that guy who can take you from your shitty college or from your like shitty desk job to this private island where the who's who of the world is flooding in their guards and having a blast so it was partly like proving myself to investors and to partly prove myself to friends that like I'm the guy that made this life experience happen that you just can't get anywhere else and we should explain the origin so you you go from magnesis I don't know what's in between but at some point you create this app called the fire app and the fire app was meant to like let you book a artist right so you could be like oh I want uh you know whatever Timberland to perform at a party I can send a booking request and he can accept or reject and there's no middlemen or minimum you know Less middlemen in the middle and so you know sort of create a Marketplace for you know people to book these artists that was the core idea and fire Festival was a marketing stunt to promote the app right but at some point the two kind of almost flipped in importance and firefestyle became the the overarching thing fire Festival starts uh from what I understand because you meet a guy who's like yo I have this little plane and I fly to these random Caribbean islands and you used to go on your weekends you know in this like four person plane hang out come back and you were like wow this is so dope people are like wow that sounds so dope you're like yeah you should come do this too and somehow your experience of like flying to these remote islands and having a having a good time became what if we fly 3 000 people down to this island and we do this like Festival this coachella-like Festival did I get that right so far I think you told the story better than me okay perfect but but somewhere along the way you get something where I'm fast forwarding this because I think you know it's documented in other places but I do want to explain it for somebody who's listening so somewhere along the way you're like all right we're doing this we're doing fire festival and you start promoting this thing and your method of promoting was what what was the marketing game plan to promote fire Festival so like it all kind of stems down too I was for all my terrible flaws I was really good at taking a tangible asset that most people didn't have and using that to launch a business so magnesis had this physical card that would cost me like two dollars to make per card and then a crazy townhouse so my entire Target demographic didn't have access to a black card they didn't have access to a multi-million dollar townhouse in downtown Manhattan when they're 23 years old so I took these two like inaccessible things gave it to my customers and used that to launch a business on top of fast forward to fire now I'm trying to cater to these you know b list rappers and comedians who need small bookings these people aren't Jay-Z they aren't Drake they don't have their own private island so here's where I come in okay now guys we have our own private island you want to be involved with me and then I use that to hopefully build the fire booking app so all my marketing strategy came down to taking a tangible good or service that wasn't available to a certain audience giving it to them making them feel like it's theirs and they own it and using that to build a business so that was the entire logic behind like the fire app and fire Festival component and as you perfectly said the importance quickly flipped as we launched the marketing for fire festival and fire Festival became it and fire app became you know a second thought for that period of time it's not like a bad plan it's not a bad idea I guess like you said like on the Pod I think when the documentaries came out we were like honestly it was a dope idea and somebody like if it had just been done like and it wasn't even like it's not like theranos where you're like that was a dope idea if somebody had just done it right it's like well maybe it's technically impossible your [ __ ] your thing was possible you just had shitty like Logistics and operations and poor planning you just threw up you just threw like the the idea of the event and then the actual the actual event did not live up to to the hype but your thing was totally possible um what what went wrong there why why were you not able to to pull off what you had sold the dream that you had sold were you Bella Hadid and you had [ __ ] I don't know Kendall Jenner and all the all these people promoting that hey we're going to this thing it's gonna be you know whatever the party of the century you sold the tickets so you got that part right it's just you didn't deliver the party do what the craziest thing is I think lying and unable to show weaknesses made the festival fail and I truly believe that my backers at the time were well connected and smart enough where it came to them and said hey look guys we did this great marketing campaign but I have no idea what the [ __ ] I'm doing they would have found like the best Festival people in the world to come and actually execute this but I was so scared to show that I couldn't handle it that I kept saying everything is great and everything is perfect and that pushed away the people that would have helped me it's like literally lying I think doomed the festival from day one post announcement who are the big Packers was it VCS or or family offices or what uh handful of venture funds and then you know 25 individuals everywhere from like larger family offices down to just smaller Angels who is the biggest fund or most well-known fund uh I just don't want to throw anybody under the bus so yeah oh okay I thought I wasn't sure if it was public uh I I think that some of the investor list was a good portion of the investor list I believe was sealed in the court files and I didn't ask for it to be sealed I think other people did so I just don't want to yeah sure don't want to do that our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better and so you uh you're like okay I I could have asked for help from uh or organizing people and this is where I think things get a little tricky so you brought up SPF um yeah I've I brought up theranos we're talking about fire Festival I think there's always a question of like was this intentionally supposed to be a fraud like oh I'm just gonna trick people and run away and uh you know like with FTX right now that's a question like did something happen that you weren't really paying attention to and then things got out of hand or from the beginning oh you were like I'm just gonna trick people and take their money um for you where did it's where did it start it like was it well intentioned at the beginning and where did it turn at what point did you realize oh I'm I'm I gotta just say this because I gotta get to the next dollar I gotta get to the next the next milestone so truly try to execute the event and literally up until people were arriving to the festival I thought it was gonna work and obviously that's so stupid looking back yeah you knew you had like [ __ ] you know tents and like grilled cheese sandwiches for for people who ordered Villas like what how could you how could you still believe that right up till the event are you sober this entire time by the way uh maybe the drugs but was like drinking a lot but no drugs drinking way too much never like I've smoked weed maybe six times in my life but I think it's like a common you know people are saying I was on Coke or whatever never tried Coke on my life so they could have a heart okay so yeah back to so you're you're in a sober-ish mindset and yeah you actually think it's gonna work the day of or the day before and I'm like Here's my thought process the island is so beautiful we have this like a local team who you couldn't script these characters they have the boats they have the jet skis they're gonna take people out like we know how to do these experiences if you have some crazy Pilots like it's just gonna be like a wild weekend that you've never had before and we have 30 artists who are paid so you're gonna have like A-list Talent one of the most beautiful places in my opinion like in the Atlantic Ocean and amazing group of these like movie scripted local characters who have toys for you to play on so I thought that like okay they'll go back and they'll have a shitty we don't have food and shelter and bathrooms but we got nature yeah yeah yeah who needs food when you have tubing but actually like I think the craziest thing is if we Market it like that it would have been amazing it would have been better okay guys I can't figure out the logistics I can't afford to to build like 500 houses but I somehow came up with the 5 million bucks for the artists we have these great people we have this great Island like bring a sleeping bag and figure this [ __ ] out I think of that mindset shift was marketed people would have been way more excited and they would have been like felt like they're owning the adventure and it would have been almost like yeah however many men years were and like the marketing like killed me at the end like the marketing sold tickets but it also made it fail what would the ideal outcome had been let's say that like it just so happened to work how much revenue and profit would it have made and like what would the ideal situation had had been so I have no idea like my entire are you [ __ ] kidding me how do you not know this so like I we had a budget for 10 million dollars for the festival I didn't have 10 million dollars but like okay I can reasonably raise 10 million dollars just off of this brand we're building right now for the festival um ended up spending way more than that and it got to the point where I would go to sleep with no money in the bank wake up and know that like that day I had to raise a certain dollar amount just to survive and some days it was 50 Grand some days it was four million dollars so I'd wake up at you know 9 A.M and know that I have until 2 pm to get X dollars in the bank to then rewire it out before the before the day ended so my life is [ __ ] hell and I just couldn't like zoom out so I was stuck okay today's two million dollars I can call this guy I can call this guy and like at the end of the day things keep getting bigger the brand is going to be so big if this Festival works everybody's gonna get paid and I just didn't like know how to really run the numbers at that point so how much did you end up spending we've raised 26 or 27 um but we were making money from other sources like we were selling tickets on top of that we were getting sponsors magnesis was making money I was doing consulting jobs so it's like literally like every day which is a different angle for money so you said maybe like 30 billion plus I would say in this six-month period it was probably closer to 40. and the tickets so you sold 7 000 tickets is that right I think it was probably just under six thousand it was just like around three thousand people per weekend some were given away for free and some were sold so we sold a little under six thousand let's call it five percent Revenue five thousand times what what's the average ticket what were you selling these for so the average the the the median ticket price was like 12 to 1500 however we sold like a handful of outlier tickets for like a couple hundred thousand dollars plus per ticket so so then it was in five thousand times two thousand you're uh what's that ten million you got 10 million yeah in sales uh and then did you have another couple million from sponsors or anything like that yeah and like the issue is that some of the ticket money was held in escrow some of it was for like these yachts and boats so it wasn't like pure 10 million dollars of free cash flow it was like everything was held up or not held up in certain ways I think like my stripe account got Frozen with like 700 Grand in the day the festival got canceled so it's like you know money was held in a bunch of different sources and areas so the the event itself didn't make any sense right it was like we're gonna make 10 million we're gonna spend 40 but you could have gotten so much more Profit just by running a 10 million or 40 million dollars of Facebook ads you know what I mean like this is just like a a better or a slightly different version of Cameo or something like that like these marketplaces are tried and true uh an event would have been cool if it were like a break even or a slight loss but that yeah but but put it this way like as for as wrong as things are and I can't do this tomorrow but if I did fire Festival again in three years I think almost all the first group as well as the rest of like pop culture would buy tickets just to be there to see how bad it is right like the brand the brand value is there just like how can I do it appropriately are you tempted to pick the right time to go I mean I have to do it again I just can't do it while I'm on probation I can't do it this year or next year but you know it has to be done again and I think no matter what success or failures I find along the way in Tech like until I execute fire have you seen his new company pirate go to the website dude trust me go to it it's p-y-r-t.com Billy like this is the same [ __ ] that you're doing a little bit like it's it's not like you said you could program like like when I see what you're doing and I you had you did the Met Gala thing where you got in trouble for scamming people out of that I'm like hey just do a [ __ ] course dude just create of course and make two million like me and Sean make seven figures a year from this stupid stuff it's not stupid it provides value but I mean it's like insignificant compared to an event or like you said you liked the program and you like content sites like just do something like boring and straight why are you doing this pirate thing it's like the same [ __ ] there's so many things that's gonna go that could potentially go wrong it's just the the stakes are so much higher than just creating some boring ass software I hear you um I think pirate is actually is that what you're suggestions no uh Billy we have uh 3 000 people coming tomorrow I hear you no you might very well be right and I think the thing that we're getting back to with pirate is like I'm not trying to host a thousand people on an island it's not gonna work I want to get back to those trips on the small planes with a dozen people or two dozen people that did work well for a couple of years and it has to be like a tour guide for a few years of my life and like eat [ __ ] like I'm gonna go do that but I can give a couple of dozen people this amazing adventurous experience and then while I'm doing that I'd like to find interesting ways to broadcast those experiences to all their followers and then give their followers a way to get involved so I'm not trying to figure out the logistics to host thousands of people I know I can host two dozen people and if I can take five years to build like really interesting like virtual reality esque Tech that allows anybody to like watch and actually influence what's happening I think that's like a really cool win and way to kind of get back to what I'm good at this is a horrible idea yeah dude it I I actually don't think it's a horrible idea if it like I think you potentially are you're you're um you rank so high in capability and so high in in ignorance like and that's like a perfect combination I think of starting a business which is like this like confidence of like I think I can pull this off and I'm capable of some things that's actually a beautiful combination but you also have this third part of the of the pie chart where it's just like reputation and like past and owing money I just don't understand why you're doing this it just you can you you are brilliant at a lot of things that just seems like such a startup just a boring ass agency that makes 20 million a year and 10 million in profit yeah if you just did like an event like a stunt marketing agency or uh or something so we have that we're announcing it today actually it's called the pirate Collective and that's how we're fun that's what we're trying to fund I guess our attack is so let's walk through this okay so I'm on the podcast I'm on the pirate website and it says there's a picture of a private island so we're already getting flashbacks of fire and then it says join the crew a pirate is somebody who turns The Impossible into Adventure he says give me your phone number and then it says join the treasure hunt virtual reality so what you're saying from what what I just gathered of what you just described is that you're gonna take you know six to 15 people at a time on those like little planes to the islands like you used to do where it's not such a heavy logistical lift um yeah those people are gonna have a great time they'll pay five grand or 10 grand or something I'm just guessing here they'll pay a lot of money to have this really cool adventurous experience and then you're going to use you know video plus maybe virtual reality to broadcast that experience to other people who can't afford to go and or maybe their friends and their social media um yeah and they get to maybe buy a virtual ticket to kind of attend the party that way and you're gonna do that a bunch of times did I describe it right or did I I'm just guessing based on what you said what you said absolutely so the last thing that you're missing is that the people who are basically so essentially we're going to partner with this little hotel they'll handle all the hospitality and Logistics we'll host artists there on a regular basis we'll rig the hotel with these 360 cameras live stream everything that's happening then give the people who are watching the live stream the ability to buy in and affect what's happening on the island so they could like have one of the artists go to the recording studio and impact the creative process when they're making their song or they can buy the talent like a drink you know and make them take a tequila shot because you should just have you gone for being Mr Beast like we hung out with Mr Beast and yeah you're wired just like that nut and uh and I feel like if you just channeled your energy towards how do I do the craziest thing that's gonna make the craziest video that 20 million people are gonna watch and then continually one up yourself uh I feel like that would work that's my suggestion to you know and you absolutely have the you have the Charisma and you have the storytelling ability just dude just do just just make you and like a small team doing the crazy [ __ ] and do ad dollars but it sounds like you're sharing you want to share your screen you could share your screen I I heard you click it around I bet you sure I'm not supposed to share this but okay but uh I want to get back to what you just said I like that attitude I like that so um this was an island we were working with unfortunately I'm not allowed to go to the Bahamas so this is just pure like demo purpose but the idea is to take like a one-to-one virtual representation of a property track where all the talent is in real time track where all the toys are in real time and then people can click into various live streams once they're watching a live stream hopefully watching their favorite Talent they could actually choose these actions to affect what's really happening there so it could be as crazy as me swimming in the reef and the users deciding to Chum the water and given the sharks in the area I think a lot of people want to see see that happen or as simple as buying somebody a drink but and what what would the financials of this be like I mean I'm sure you've now thought about that more you're like what would the p l what would what does this no it surely has it's like one day one day it could do this what's that one day so a million people paying 20 cents to ask a talent to do something or to contribute an action towards like the real world so if everybody pays 20 cents to Chum the water and a million people are chumming the water then that's kind of where the financials come in sorry I can't do that just tell me like in in five years are you in your head you're like I think we could do like a hundred million dollars in eight years like what what's the you're not getting me arrested Sam I don't want to promise any Revenue but no no sorry don't promise I'm just saying like when you're laying in bed you're like I think this could become like a 100 million dollar Company by doing this I think what's the way I think about this and my logic could be wrong is that once again I we're not going to be using the Bahamas but for example the Bahamas gets around four-ish million tourists a year and if we're doing these really interesting broadcasts we can have more than four four million people in a single day like virtually come to the island so if we can just like totally destroy their tourism numbers in a virtual scale I think it's a big Revenue opportunity so okay so where did you come up with this idea were you in prison or was it once you got out that you were like all right I'm gonna start my brainstorm no I was in solitary confinement and it's like totally totally confined and you know a lot of it was just like reflection and then a lot of it too is I want to get outside of these walls and just like get back to Adventure and then find a way to share this so we should say by the way that's kind of where you got into solitary because you attempted to do a podcast from inside prison yeah uh terribly what well first did you know that was not allowed was that I didn't even realize that would be such a faux pas like that that was that would be such a course that would be a faux pas I think the biggest thing is great dude they read your mail and [ __ ] you can't like and like each [ __ ] each inmate you have like different roles for you right like if a journalist calls you and you do an interview is that allowed that's allowed um I was wrong the toughest part though is like it was a gray area I think if it was a clear violation of the rules My Punishment would have been like less strict I used the pay phone like their available pay phones um but at the same time like you can't cause attention to the jail right and that's what I did so I understand like why it was like so incredibly stupid but I think if I had a clear violation of the rules I would have gone to solitary for like 45 days and not seven months you basically had a podcast host call you on the pay phone and then you did your side of the podcast from the pay phone in like 10 minute or 15 minute increments right because that's what you were allowed exactly exactly okay yeah I mean I understand why you think that's great it's like what's the difference between prostitution and pornography you know it's like I don't know if there's a camera there it's like you're you're safe like you know I mean like you're like playing this like uh like I don't know if I would be if I would be risking things at that moment I mean I I've done I've when I was in college I did stupid stuff and I got in trouble and I remember getting in trouble and thinking like I don't ever want to come back to jail again and more so solitary confinement seems like I would kill myself I think I would want to commit suicide like that sounds like that's like the seven months in a box it seems like the worst that's the worst possible outcome let alone like you know getting life you know like El Chapo and some of these guys in in these like Florence and all these like high high level security what was that like seven months being in that cell I get anxious just thinking about it I actually think that it's counterproductive in terms of Reform if that kind of makes sense and the other time in jail like I don't think it's going to have a long lost long-lasting negative impacts in my life I did 10 months total in solitary one time for three one time for seven I think like that actually makes it more likely that I make a mistake in the future and obviously if I do make a mistake it's totally on me but like the mental hangover that I have where it's like somebody out there could snap their fingers and put me into a concrete box like that's scary like that's what gives me the nightmares at night and I think that like if anything that makes you know ideas bigger or different because you're kind of fearful of that outcome so I don't know it's [ __ ] hard and like there are guys who have done way more than 10 months and I can't imagine what they feel like but I think that's like the worst part of the experience and actually it's just counterproductive did you know it was going to be seven months or is it like do you know there's an end point or you didn't know no and I think if they said hey this is seven months then you're getting out and then you're going home the year after that it would have been totally different but the fact that they kept [ __ ] with me basically saying hey you're never getting out of here you're gonna get in trouble more like that was the biggest mind [ __ ] you just like wake up every morning and be like this is never gonna end why like you mean the the guards were just [ __ ] yeah in the jail they literally in response to the podcast they tried to send me to a terrorist facility called the CM the CMC in Marion Illinois you can like look at their inmates on Wikipedia like I'd be one of two non-terrorist in that facility and they would come and [ __ ] with me and like pass like program statements under my door for this communication management unit like here's where you're going McFarland and like I thought they were bluffing and then like a day later oh we submitted you there and like it legitimately tried to send me to a terrorist facility and it's like you're never getting out what's gonna happen that is [ __ ] crazy I I think that like whenever I was thinking I remember talking to my wife at the time when you were getting in trouble and I'm like unfortunately I think four or five years probably is a fair is it's probably a fair punishment I don't think solitary is a fair punishment and I don't think being like tormented is fair though you know like let's just say you went to jail not because you threw a bad Festival you went to jail for what was the exact reason lying to investors and like and you lied what about the financials or what did you lie about yes badly financials Revenue personal company what were you doing what were you doing wire fraud I think is the the main charge but there are a couple couple surrounding charges as well but basically anytime you lie to get money it's essentially wire fraud in the eyes of the federal government but you you are making fake documents like you were photoshopping things and making fake PDFs I think right yeah I made I just made fake like Excel documents basically saying hey our income is x million this month and it wasn't close so I was you know totally guilty it was it wasn't like it wasn't a gray area I was black and white wrong right the festival was better than I advertised which is obviously impossible I still haven't gone to jail when you um so I remember being like okay wow that's crazy uh sounds like you know he got kind of in over his head you know and I I was having some sort of sympathy in a way and then there was some story like when you were on probation then you did something else you created something called like VIP access or some [ __ ] like that Gala yeah and then that was also like you know you know freaking little figures in some way what was that and how do you defend that part right because that's after the fact now yeah and you're you're already on probation and and was it just like I just had a habit of doing this what was going on there the only defense is that I was a [ __ ] idiot like there's no other way to to to get around that um yeah I was totally wrong and I kind of got in this mindset where it's all about the money I'm like that's probably wrong but then figured hey I need to find a way to pay everybody back and let's get back to what I was doing at magnesis at the end to kind of fun fire Festival which is to sell these tickets right and you needed like you needed like a like if I was your father I would have just I would have punched you in the [ __ ] face and I'd be like Billy like this is you're you're hurting me you're like you're you're hurt like you needed like a like uh like someone just to be like dude you are so talented but you are [ __ ] this up so much it's like these are such clear mistakes I don't understand why I don't understand like did you not have a friend that was like it sounds like you were trying to trying to do a quick fix if I can get the money back if I could pay people back then I'm not going to get in trouble about the other thing is that is that accurate is what you were thinking I was scared of jail like no one was picking up my calls anymore I'm on you know on bond I guess and like I just couldn't once again I couldn't zoom out and understand the bigger picture where if I sat down shut the [ __ ] up yeah sure I'll be broke for a couple of years but I'll go to jail for two or three years and I'll get out my late 20s and you know have a chance to pay people back the right way and I just like couldn't understand that but yeah I think that like going forward a big thought process for me and it's been three months is you know how do I position myself whether like whether it's a company or something else like to get the help I need and do I operate within a bigger company do I find like partners that you know are senior to me and experience in age who I can like trust and defer to so it's just all part of my journey right now and I think that like this time around I think I prefer those boundaries more and it's just trying to find it and it's been you know super early in the process are you gonna raise funding for this next company I I think a lot of people I don't know but if I had a bet I would say you probably actually could raise I bet you there's people that would give you money is that so I I texted a I texted like eight Venture funds a few weeks ago and you know was literally like a broken grammar like two-line sentence like two told me to [ __ ] off like you know one didn't respond you know one asked for more questions and four just like responded in like you know within a minute saying we're in um the issue is you know as I've kind of gone through the process I'm actually not allowed due to an SEC deal um I'm not allowed to raise Securities so I can't go and raise money uh I think the ironic part is that like it's probably gonna it would have been easier this time to raise Venture money and like no decks like none of that [ __ ] like I said I have no decks here's all here's all I have and uh yeah people want to back it I just can't raise the funds so and I I think that would shock people is that yeah you know you just had a 50 hit rate on uh on a text message how do you explain that to somebody who's listening and they're like you know there's some people who are frustrated that that's the case I can't believe people would find him how would you explain to them because it's people people are making this decision they're smart people they're capable people they have other options yeah uh how would you explain why why somebody would be willing to do that so I started trying to raise money for the first time almost 12 over 12 years ago now and you know as with everybody the first ex-people told me to [ __ ] off and kind of laughed at me and like so I went through 12 years of [ __ ] including 10 months of solitary confinement to like get to the point where maybe an investor believes that I've learned enough lessons to focus on what I'm good at get help with what I'm bad at so it's not like it's like wake up one day and can raise money it was it was it's been 12 years of just like totally [ __ ] up to get to this point but yeah and I think that before I raise money and obviously like legally I can't do it and I'm not going to be allowed to do it is I need the help right and I need like the system and the structure in place where let me go and market and like come up with these experiences and Adventures and you know Drive attention but have somebody else who could just help me manage like financials and Logistics and operations what other ideas did you have if you weren't going to do something fire festivaly uh did you have like other I'm sure you had a lot of time on your hands to think of other ideas did you think about any other potential potential things you could do with your time maybe not even businesses yeah just other things you might do um I think if someone wants to go on an early really understand uh gpt3 like the what's kind of power in the open Ai and just become an expert on that I think you can be like make a killing as a consultant and like teaching all these big Brands like what's happening there and like what's gonna happen the thing that's like one option to kind of go and like become a gpt3 like expert and like be the YouTuber Brands is your experience with gbt3 since sorry when you got out six months ago uh yeah I actually was reading about it for like a year in jail uh didn't even like know open AI was a name in the company or anything like that but it's like had random book sent in so I was like oh this is super interesting and like have dozens of pages and notes on it maybe I'll post them but like and then kind of come out and see what happened recently which is pretty cool so I agree I think that could be a great company and I bet you'd kill it because you're pretty good at selling uh yeah by the way you yes I think if I was close with you I'd be like Billy do that uh what what else what else has excited you what other ideas I think the concept of fire app which is providing transparency to a lot of these like Legacy Entertainment Systems is interesting um one I think which is really interesting right now is like Performance Marketing for like social media and influencers so I think one the reason why the fire just take a step back the reason why the fire Festival marketing I think works so well is at the exact same time we had 400 people post this orange tile but these 400 people weren't related right it was some music artists like some comedians some athletes some models so when you're in our target audience and you're scrolling through your Instagram feed you're like why the [ __ ] are these five people who don't know each other all posting this right now like I need to go check this out so one idea I had is that basically creating like a Marketplace for influencer marketing where let's say like Starbucks has a new coffee that they want to advertise they can go and upload all their creative assets and set like a million dollar budget and then anybody around the world could take those assets and post it to their Instagram or their Tick Tock or their YouTube and then they basically get a score for how much engagement they get in their content and their overall score gets them a percentage of the budget so if Kim Kardashian posts it and she crushes it you know she gets 900 Grand 100 000 is split up to you know another million people who all kind of posted I think it's like a fun way to remove all these [ __ ] middlemen in this whole social marketing world and then allow a brand to turn all of their followers into advertisers for that company without dealing with any of the legwork it's almost like clout do you remember clout with a K yeah yeah I do like yeah overall social score right yeah and it it it they raised a ton of money and probably sold for less than their valuation of 100 million dollars or I think they sold for 100 which was less I think than what they raised at but I actually thought it was a fantastic idea for some reason it didn't work I don't know why but you you'd be in that space a little bit it sounds like yeah I think it's interesting it's like providing a score to how well your content performs and getting paid off of that but then turning everybody into your promoters yeah I think that's a really cool idea uh it also flips the model on its head right now you have to do sort of individual manual Outreach and then negotiations and then whatever versus just saying it's in the reverse here's a giant honey pot if you want it go get it you know um and then basically divving it up based on the actual performance versus uh you know who can negotiate the best you know uh okay so that's a really cool idea what else you got yeah yeah those are my two so I love you too ppt3 expert and then providing Like An Open Marketplace where Brands can upload their creative assets and anybody can kind of publish them and get paid business and why not do that one yeah and why not why why do you set it on the one versus those two I mean they sound quite reasonable yeah maybe I'll do them yeah no you won't and I don't think you will I think like I don't know I don't think you will like I don't know I guess you just have this like you must have a fire in you where you're no pun intended where you're like I have to go this event route which is which is baffling I mean but I guess people just passionate people are passionate about certain things I get it yeah but uh logically I just I have such I don't want to see you fail I guess I want to see you succeed and like prove people wrong and I I want to prove that like Second Chances could work and so when I see this I'm like oh man you're just playing this game on hard mode like yeah I think you're not making the same mistakes on the obviously on the uh I have no idea but like that'd be crazy if you're making the same mistakes as far as what got you into prison but you're also choosing a business model that's super hard uh like you know you're talking about a million people paying 20 cents to Chum the waters and it's like I don't even know like those words have never even been said together uh right so it's like you know you're choosing to try to pull off a really uh really really difficult thing um yeah and you know it just seems like I guess Like My Philosophy is always like in in business there's no extra points for difficulty um in fact you get you're getting docked points for difficulty the harder something is uh you know the less money you end up making and and so there are no bonus points for doing things the hard way now on the other side there is one advantage which is when you go do something cool and audacious every day you wake up and you're motivated and maybe you can recruit people who are motivated to pull off something epic um because epic things have their own you know motivational draw to actually go and do your best work which which he just did I saw on your Twitter and I think Tick Tock you said hey everyone I'm hiring for my new thing how many uh applicants did you get yeah so back to a business idea I think it's really interesting is we partner with a company called Bounty Hunter world to hire and they're trying to disrupt the whole recruiter model where they're saying anybody can refer a friend to a job and if you successfully refer someone you get paid that recruiting fee and as you guys know like those fees could be crazy so I think like they're super awesome and then we tried to like one-up it so we're saying anybody who refers a friend to Pirate that we end up hiring we take that person on one of these pirate experiences so trying to like give the island Entertainer experience to like any of our fans um we've had a lot of people apply for jobs I think the craziest thing is like we have no money and I'm probably like paying 15 to 20 of what I was paying for the same role five or six years ago and probably getting like better people so think it all goes to show like your mission and your intention is just so much more important than anything how big is the list of this like I put my phone number into this thing how big is the list how many people have have signed up to like do the treasure hunt around two thousand Okay so yeah it's not bad I'm shocked you didn't get more because the milk boys thing that got 1.5 million views that I've been getting a lot of inbound it's like social like Instagram DMs I think are just have gone crazy um I think the conversion's like a phone number through a platform has been a little bit harder for us but yeah overall like how do we kind of organize all these DMS and maybe that's a different business too if someone can build an inbox that takes inbound across like Instagram DMS uh LinkedIn like in mail your like your public email address and organize all of that and like kind of qualify those leads that's something that I would pay for on a monthly basis and you like you're you're and you're building all of this right now with I think you said you collected 150k in Revenue so far from like brand deals or something like that and so yeah November first yeah so you're building this bit oh since November 1st well I mean that's a pretty good run rate already yeah so but you're you're building this business now you have 170 000 just to to play with that's kind of what your starting point yeah don't worry we spent it already did you really I mean like we're just trying to trying to survive so dude have you ever heard of like pilot or badge dude there's these like really good accounting like software companies that you could use it's like a thousand a month and they'll just like tell you like your p l like yeah you should or like a or like a part-time CFO like I don't know man maybe that would be a good investment I need all of it I need like I need help yeah have you ever heard of QuickBooks I mean like I don't know man I think you should like really sweat the details on this stuff FDX use QuickBooks and look what happens well correlation not causation but I know I mean speaking of that what do you think you you know I've been following we had um Sean and I have both interacted a bit with Martin shkreli and unfortunately you know you're in the same vein there's you there's Martin and then there's now uh uh I think Sean doesn't like SPF because winners don't get accurate winners don't get nicknamed he's just he's just Samuel now but what do you think what's your take on the uh what's gonna happen with him uh 40 years and then hopefully after like yeah then he'll get out after like 15 to 20. do you think that's fair that's my guess um I don't know I talked to Martin after he got out and I was like what was it like in prison and he had a bunch of stories where he's like yeah I created a cryptocurrency study Club I uh you know I I had like you know all these like he's like yeah we had the system where I was you know selling information blah blah I was reading tons of books I had access to the internet he's like I would be under the covers at night like basically watching uh Khan Academy videos learning about like calculus and um what's it what do you do to pass the time what was your life like I think the hardest part about prison is it's designed to strip you of your ambition right because like there are great people there and I bet some really incredible people but there also are a lot of bad people and you can't put bad people into an environment where they're inspired and they have ambition to act on their bad impulses so there's this concept of being institutionalized and essentially it's meant to just make you a human robot and I think it's like good in a certain way that it makes it time easier but like naturally I was just trying to fight against like all like the set processes as much as possible so I think it made my time go really really slow I was trying to fight to like find ways to stay creative what's the next environment meant to make you robot like they feed you at the same time every day like they turn the lights off at the same time you can only use your phones from a certain period of time like just everything is like structured like this like you have to wear your uniform to go to lunch and it's like if you're trying to find ways where like you know trying to find my creative periods and just not make every day the same so I can just like keep different ideas flowing and coming what were some things you did successfully to kind of like amuse yourself what was little what were your maybe a little tactics the little wins you had as to keep that creative you know spark alive yeah uh training a lot of boxing so um I had like a soulmate who's a performer Puerto Rican like professional boxer and he could like wrap his hands with towels and like you know train me in boxing which is super fun um we didn't have that guys take like toilet paper rolls and wrap them in tube socks and use that like for for mitts so yeah it's like finding like creative ways to to go and like exercise and for your mind and like do little things you're not supposed to it doesn't hurt anybody like you couldn't practice martial arts but you know you go in the back and have the guy hold your mitts for you for a half hour you can kind of get away with it it's like a good good way to escape you look like you're in better shape yeah I was fat as hell what are some um stereotypes that you know we would have about your experience that either proved to be true or like that maybe weren't true uh about the whole experience the whole like racial segregation totally holy thing yeah yeah totally thing um I think like being in New York I'm a little naive and spoiled to I I guess like a lot of what probably exists in other parts of the world but literally being in a place where if you're black you go on this line for lunch and if you're white you go on this line for lunch and you just can't cross over it's like wild it just like feels like it's 60 years behind the times and obviously something that I haven't experience in in New York and and like probably spoil to that sense but really kind of getting over the racial issues or I think kind of a weird hard part for me and it's probably like what's weird about it is like when they separate by races it's not always out of a place of hate it's just like no this is just you stay with us they go with them yeah and it's not necessarily that they're they hate the other group it's just this is just how we do things yeah it's always been done this way it's just how we're going to do it and like there certainly are terrible racists on both sides but the majority aren't there's like this is the way it's done so this is the way we're gonna do it like it doesn't really make sense but if you could go in and change one way that the prison system works well while still you know achieving the goal and the job to be done of of a prison what would you change uh now that you've kind of saw it from the inside I think that I would make sentencing more equal across the board and there are a lot of people who committed the exact same crime Hood wildly different sentences and this is almost like an interesting problem maybe this is a really cool business is to build some sort of like AI sentencing thing because like right now it's up to one independent judge and that judge like in my case I could have gotten nothing or I could have gotten 20 years I'm like literally one person can decide the fate of your life um and I think what I got is fair for me but many other people's senses weren't fair so maybe it's some sort of system that takes in all the information around someone's crime and their personal life then studying everybody else who has had similar crimes and seeing who was successful and actually sentencing based on this idea of you know future success well what are some examples of different punishments or different sentences based off a different similar crimes so I think for my situation it was a financial crime and typically your sentence is based on what the dollar amount that victims lost is so the more you lose the more time you should get I think like there's plenty of people who were from New York whose dollar amounts were hundreds of millions of dollars who got one or two years then I go out to a jail in Detroit where there's people who have lost five hundred thousand dollars who got 30 years so it's like just like they're just total disparity where it shouldn't be like that I don't think sentences are based on future success and some judges are like I think kind enough and smart enough to do that but but some aren't so almost like having this AI system that recommends a sentence in addition to the judge there's like a different data point I think it'd be super interesting yeah that's that's a cool that is crazy because like it could be like that this happens where a judge is in a bad mood or uh has seen certain patterns that are biased and yeah I mean that is it is pretty wild you know I've had friends like go through some of this stuff and they're like oh he this person was in a great mood today and I just or I just happened to get this person who falls under this political party and this is what happened it is that is pretty crazy It's just tough I'm like look at Elizabeth Holmes she realistically could have gotten two years or she got it she could have gotten 35 years right and it's like it's up to one person to determine like what that length of time is and that's a it's like a big task for someone to take on and yeah unfortunately the system isn't fair yeah so do they have like a like a like you know if you go to a company and you're gonna get a job it's not just up to the manager to just pick a random number for what you get to get paid it's like no we know for this job title with this many years of experience this is the range and the range is between this this and this and if you're going to go outside of that range you got to have like a pretty strong indicator and it's like people have to be notified that I'm going way outside the range the the normal like expected range in order to make this offer uh it's almost like they kind of need that or I don't maybe they have a version of that for judges who are trying to send this they have a guideline system that gives you a recommended range and that definitely helps and it's good I think the issue though is that it's really hard for the judge to get to know someone such a short period of time and those who have access to Great attorneys have an advantage because like your attorney's entire job in the federal system is like you're going to lose the case it's all about presenting who you really are as a person and why you should be afforded a second chance at some point in the future so people who don't have access to Quality attorneys just don't really have that same opportunity to explain why this should have a second chance and so I think that the AI probably benefits more of your like lower income defendant which is most of them who can't afford their own attorneys to to show they're more of a human than just like what the crime is did you have a fancy lawyer I had a good lawyer so like and I just made it impossible for him right like getting in trouble again on bail there's like nothing he could have done oh just opposed [ __ ] like I could have had 20 lawyers it wouldn't have mattered I would have you know have Sean have you ever seen the movie Catch Me If You Can of course great movie and so I read about that guy a lot Frank abnaily Jr and turns out most of what like he he made this book about his crimes and turns out it's likely like mostly lies I think like they prove like he's been proven time and time again that he didn't actually do what he said he did in terms of crimes but he like glamorized it and then he turned it into like a pretty successful Consulting business I don't know how big but like I looked up where he lives and he's got like a you know multi-million dollar home and he's always wearing these nice suits and he looks like he's he's done a good job when I look at him Billy I'm like well that guy is kind of like a good example of like what you know turning [ __ ] into gold and like turning a situation around what did you ever think about kind of going that route like I think that like I would just yeah I'd hate to live off of like fire for the rest of my life and then there's like a short window opportunity where the attention from it will allow my next business just to start with the springboard but I'd much rather be known for and fail or succeed at a new business than being someone who just talks about fire festival for next 30 Years like that's boring as [ __ ] but I I understand why some people would would want it I agree it is boring but when you you know are in debt of 25 million dollars it's like well you know like I unfortunately I have to sacrifice my excitement in order to like make this work on the other hand he has got nothing to lose really well what does he have to lose he's got like all right well starting back from scratch reputation was pretty tainted and in a pretty deep restitutional hole where you got to pay back like 25 30 million dollars or something like that why not swing and do what you want with your life versus uh you know I guess I guess it is there in a way it is it is a good idea to just go for like the mo whatever is the most sort of exciting and fun and fulfilling thing for you and how do you find Pride right like I think that talking about it like a failed business when I was 24 and 25 when I'm 40 I'm not gonna wake up with juice to keep going like I think like if I see somebody else doing that I'm like oh what a [ __ ] loser I kind of want to be that person so I'd rather go and like try to improve and like whether I fail or succeed is try something new and different and try to build something so if it all works if life goes the way you want it and you're now 65 70 years old what Billy McFarland who who is he what happened if it all works out for you yeah he took his failures learned from it used it as a springboard to build something new and like whether it's pirate or something else that I do in 10 years from now and and one for it but like made good friends and help people along the way and if I can pay back 25 million dollars amazing if I pay back a million dollars but you know I try it and do it honestly like that's okay too I think and yeah and I actually I think that a lot of the investors listening would probably agree with that if as long as it's kind of done the right way I think at this point it's less about the money and more about how I change well we appreciate you coming on you know this was like uh when we were I Was preparing for this and I was like man I don't know how to approach this I don't want to like glamorize someone who's done something bad but like this was a really confusing thing to do but I'm happy we are able to talk I I'm gonna be following your story very closely I'm very eager to see how you pulled this off um and frankly I want you to pull you know I want I want Redemption to be real and and I want it to work everyone deserves a second chance so I hope I hope it does thank you guys super cool to finally be here so Sam and Sean thank you guys thanks for coming on foreign ", "word_count": 15876}]
