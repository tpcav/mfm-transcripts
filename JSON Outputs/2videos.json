million downloads this year for the podcast which is I think six times bigger than last year my or maybe four or five five times I might have my math on there but I think YouTube's up 6X and the Pod is up 4X or something like that um big gear big year for us which is which is fun and Andrew you were the most frequent guest you're the most favorite guest and so it is only right to have you here all right so without further Ado should we jump in to the categories we're gonna go uh I'll announce the category I think and there we go kind of round robin um last year we did it where we kind of picked who had the best answer after each one I don't know if you guys want to do that or uh any any adjustments to the format here well I think by the way your order was a little off so for example if we're going to start with Billy of the year then that has the next person because it's also a the next category should be craziest person of the year as well okay okay well let's do it this way um we'll take turns uh me and you say I'm just picking categories and then uh you can go whatever order you want so okay let's start let's start with Billy of the year uh so for those who don't know we do the segment called Billy of the week where we typically will feature a billionaire or somebody who maybe is not actually technically a billionaire but they carry themselves with that billionaire energy and uh somebody who's just doing life in an interesting way so Sam who is your Billy of the Year ah mine's so boring so okay uh my boric answer is Zuck because he's proven that like he's actually pretty good all these everyone else this year that's been in his category has gone [ __ ] insane Bezos got a divorce elon's crazy all Zuck does is box that's like his version of crazy like he's turned out to be okay so I would say he's probably like emotionally stable huh yeah he's done all right but if I had to pick another one it would be this guy named Brett Adcock Brett Adcock is this guy I met about six months ago he basically is only 34 to 36 years old he's a young guy he made a lot of money when he sold his company called veteri for 100 million dollars then he created veterans like a recruiting company he's not sexy but then he created a flying drone company that he took public called Archer it was worth two or three billion at its peak now he told me that he's uh took roughly 200 million dollars of his own money which I think was like the majority of his liquid net worth other than the house that he owns and he's piled all of it into bootstrapping a new robotic company called uh where they make humanoids and that guy's pretty [ __ ] insane and I love crazy people like that that's a great one Andrew who you got Billy of the year so my mine is actually a MFM guest Palmer lucky um I feel like you know it's a little obvious but I feel like um you see so many of these billionaires who they make all this money and then they get very focused on PR and they're very safe and they won't put their money where their mouth is and what I loved about him is that a he's actually taking his own capital and investing it in and drill and doing something that is actually important in the world or what he deems important and he actually just like calls people out like he's honest he's not a politician and I think most of these billionaires you talk to they are very political they have a PR team he obviously does not I thought that was so awesome when he went to the uh what is it the all-in conference and just roasted calcamus for like an hour um so yeah mad respect I think he's awesome and I thought that was one of the best interviews of the year that's a great one um I love that one I thought I considered Palmer lucky as well I decided to go with somebody a little more under the radar not a billy not a billionaire but somebody who lives like I think a billionaire should so it's this guy who came to Camp MFM which was our kind of like private retreat of 20 or 30 badass people that we did who Al no Syed Saeed said so Saeed is a guy I didn't know much about you had mentioned him before I didn't I never met him he might be a billionaire he might be but uh but it doesn't matter he lives like one so when we met him at the camp I was like so what do you do he first of all he just had the most chill energy he was not stressed he was not worried he was not seeking attention he was he had none of those small boy traits and instead he was relaxed he was having fun he was asking people questions and I asked him I said so what do you what do you do and he's like well you know I and he he started to explain and somebody else cut him off and was like let me brag for you for a second here so what Syed owns is basically the largest collection of Wordpress websites and tools so if you search for WordPress like you know WordPress powers like 30 or 40 of all internet websites and so people are often searching how do I do this on my WordPress site you'll land typically on one of his websites like wpbeginner or WP engine or whatever and from there it'll say well if you want to capture emails of people who come in using Wordpress like a email capture pop-up use optinmonster owned by also Saeed and so he basically has the landing spot where people come he's got the number one search rankings then he owns the tools that he refers and so he turned his random curious traffic into SAS subscribers it basically built an Empire he's telling us about the gas stations he owns and all the other crazy stuff he does with his money and his work style was was one that I envy he's like well here's my month the last week of the month I do all my meetings with the operators of my businesses I was like so what do you do the other three weeks and he's like one egg one to one and a half weeks we travel so we just go to Costa Rica then we go to Egypt then we go wherever like me my family we just love to travel and then I read and I just chill out and I think uh the other the other week and a half I play with my son a lot we play basketball and I was like wow this guy is dominating his business Niche but he's also checking the Box on family he's checking the Box on travel he's got it going on so I was really impressed by Syed this he also very very uh giving too he he gives away a lot of money too yeah amazing guy so uh so he's mine that's uh all right so those are the billies of the year I I'll just put it out there I think Palmer was the right answer what do you think Sam I agree Palmer was the right answer you're if you haven't seen the clip of him going to Jason calacanus's conference like going to someone's birthday party and roasting them uh that was epic Andrew did you hear on our pod when we asked Palmer if you could kick Jason's ass yeah when he was talking about his scare his like how tall he was he goes yeah he was like well you know if you look at the physics of this I I forget exactly how he explained it but he was like a very engineer he goes like six one yeah he said something like that like it it was pretty funny all right let's go to the next category Sam you can pick one um let's talk about the biggest L we each took this year okay Andrew you go first Adrian by the way this category the biggest l so it's the biggest loss you took but it can be it doesn't have to be like a big serious thing it's just it's just a loss that you put in the in the Lost column however big or small it was in your life yeah so I read this book about 15 years ago by this guy ramit Sethi uh he's got a website I will teach you to be rich and he's got a book called I will teach you to be rich and at the time I knew absolutely nothing about personal finance or Finance at all and he had this really great section where he says people think they need to save money on lattes what they actually need to save money on is percentages and so he's talking about interest rates on credit cards interest rates on mortgage uh fees and real estate transactions like the difference between two percent and 2.5 percent is like twenty thousand dollars and people don't think about that he says uh he goes don't worry about three dollar problems worry about worry about thirty thousand dollar problems exactly so I had one of those um so you know maybe like two episodes of you know a couple interviewers ago I talked about um you know interest rates and the risks there and this was very top of mind because we had a piece of debt in the company that uh I wanted to lock in the interest rate on one and so we were going to buy all these Hedges and in order to do that I had to sign all these documents and I'm kind of lazy I hate signing documents and so these documents were sitting in our office and I was like oh I'll do it tomorrow I'll do it tomorrow I kept putting it off and then finally I signed it and I realized that between the time that I it was sitting there for a week and in that week the interest rate went up by like one percent and that represented like five hundred thousand dollars or something insane and so just me being lazy and not signing that document and not thinking in percentages cost me like 500 Grand that's a great one um this year I met a guy who had an app called intro it's a great app and I agreed to do it because he was like hey come try this and I did and it was one of the big bigger mistakes of the year that I made so basically I'm on this app called intro where for a little while people could you you were bragging about how you were crushing it on intro how is this the L that's such a weak move on my part to do it so this app I got on there because I was like oh you know and honestly it's fun it is quite fun to use it's fun to like meet new people but people pay me for my time and it's quite addicting because it's real you can make a substantial amount of money doing that but if I'm supposed to be such a big swing of dick if I'm supposed to be a hot shot like I want to be I shouldn't be selling my time or at least I shouldn't be selling my time and keeping the money I should just give it away and it was that was a big uh that was a weak move on my part to uh be selling my time and I regret doing that that's a that's a great one I was making fun of you for that and uh and then I was also kind of like wait should I be doing that that is a lot of money don't sell your time don't sell your time such short-term thinking and you know who really changed my opinion of it who actually could be Billy the year what's the guy Brian Johnson Brian Johnson from um uh Braintree he like kind of like didn't mean to do it but he like was razzmy on using it and I was like you're right what did I say that wasn't he was telling us well he told the story he didn't he wasn't directing it towards me but he told the story about how he was like instead of like getting this job like I should just put more effort into my company so then in three years this won't even be a problem instead of right now I could just make this money that could temporary fix this no I should go for the long-term fix and make it so like I don't even have to budget ever again yeah I see a lot of so I think like all three of us kind of probably grew up not having a ton of money um and really really valuing like every dollar right so like I remember um you know a thousand dollars was like a crazy amount of money to me because I could buy an iMac and if I bought an iMac then I could have one of my staff do all this work and I could make like twenty thousand dollars from it and so I feel like I still if I I'm not careful I think in those terms and when someone comes along and offers you a thousand dollars an hour it's like completely insane as an opportunity or like three grand an hour or four grand for an hour it is crazy it's amazing but you get and I know all these people that are like I know guys that are worth 50 million dollars and they still manage their own Airbnb bookings and they'll be like oh sweet I tweaked this I made an extra 300 in cleaning fees or whatever and I always think like you guys used a quote before but it's like you're playing you're playing a pennies or sorry you're you're saving pennies in a dollars game like it's just ridiculous yeah that's uh yeah but some people enjoy that like Nathan Barry uh Nathan Berry owns convertkit he's probably worth 200 plus million dollars based off the valuation convertkit and he's still I'll be with him and applaud his phone and he's like messaging Airbnb guests I'm like why are you doing this he goes I love it and so in that case I'm like all right cool I don't like taking intro calls necessarily sometimes I do but uh yeah yeah there's a there's a good test I remember I talked to this guy when we got acquired by twitch I talked to a guy who had been acquired by twitch three years ago and I was like yo let's get lunch so we go out for lunch and I'm like um you know he's like yeah you're gonna love it you know yeah but watch out for this he's like giving me a bunch of tips I'm like okay great um let me give you a tip real quick uh yeah I just got here but let me give you a tip I was like why are you still here and he's like oh dude um I really like my job actually you know I I didn't think I would stay here but I really like it you know it's it's fun I just blah blah he tells you tell me how great it is but I had kind of seen him in a couple meetings at this point and I was like these meetings aren't fun so like you know I don't know what you're doing the other hours a day but I saw you for like half a day last week and that that didn't seem fun at all um I said okay well maybe it is fun but let me just ask you something um you made you know he probably made like 10 20 million dollars on sale I said uh I said you don't need this job but uh but but you're not at the point where for you you're just gonna stop working all together blah blah and I said uh I said if you had 100 million dollars in the bank like literally like if I open up your bank account right now is 100 million dollars just sitting there would you come into work tomorrow like would you would you would you do this just for fun because at that point you know what you're making here every year is a rounding error it's a you you just make that in in an interest uh if you were uh if you had 100 million dollars sitting there he's like well no then I would go do XYZ and I was like okay cool so this as long as we're just being honest like I'm not saying you're miserable here I agree but the stories we tell ourselves in order to justify doing something that we're actually doing for the money but we don't want to say we're doing it for the money we want to say we're doing it for all these other reasons there's a very simple test imagine you had all the money would you still do this thing and like but the other the other the dangerous thing about that logic so Ryan holiday has this great daily stoic podcast and re recently he had um a excerpt from Stephen pressfield's book he's got all these books about kind of discovering your thing and your Mastery and art and all this kind of stuff and he talks about how people get addicted to patterns so people can be addicted to um love they they can be addicted to money they could be addicted to you know any almost anything and the question I always ask myself is I might love designing the website or I might love going into the Shopify stats and seeing the sales or doing the Airbnb management but is that just me addicted to those dopamine hits distracting myself from my greater purpose right from doing something where I have Mastery that's new am I just going back to the same thing right like you guys know the joy there's this amazing confirmation bias Joy of reading a book and hearing something you already know confirmed over and over and over again I'll do this with like uh value investing books right and I'll go oh I already know that I do that I feel good right that's actually a waste of time and so that's the flip side of it the other one is uh my buddy told me this when I when I'd been working on my startup for six or seven years and he was like he's like he told me he's like you know I just don't get what you're doing I was like well what do you mean I can explain it and he's like no not the logic of it he's like I just feel like let me ask you a question if this all went away is this what you would sign up to go do like would you basically like like take the example of the guy I was talking to if you got if you weren't doing this job is it would you just apply for this job here no you would go do something completely different like you're here because you got Acquired and then you're here and now fast forward three or four years later you're still here doing the same job but if I took this job away you would never go to a job posting and apply for this job and he's and so he was explaining that he's like you know inertia is just a [ __ ] he's like whatever your an object in motion will stay in motion whatever you're doing you're probably most likely you're doing it because you were already doing it not because you think it's the thing you actually should do in most cases and so you got to be really aware of that all right um so what's yours okay so uh wait what is the category even what are we in your biggest l oh my biggest L okay I have one that's sort of like yours I was chasing pennies in a dollar game so I recently moved and uh your boy rents I'm a renter and so I moved from one rental to another a new house and I was like oh I love this I could just like move whenever I want don't have to worry about anything just call the movers I broke my lease I just moved but um my landlord came in and uh first you know did a walk through of the place when I was there you know we talked about his you know his family his history in this house shook hands in the garage said you know it's been nice having you all right see you later you know don't worry about all the stuff everything looks fine three weeks later he hits me with like a 20 or 30 000 bill and um at least twenty thousand he gets me with the extra twenty thousand dollar bill on the move out for like you know scratches and like you know stuff like with he right no he was not right it was and he had he's a lawyer so he had baked into the lease that like hey anything that's associated with the move out is your cost like for example if I fly to California to observe the move out you have to pay for my flights my hotels my food my this my like there's a [ __ ] in there that was like not like I didn't damage the property it was just like extra stuff but he had put it in the lease I had signed the lease because like you know like Andrew I don't really I I don't really read it or if I read it I'm not going to read what are words yeah it's like uh you know I'm optimistic at the beginning of things I'm like this is gonna go great he's gonna be a chill dude just like I would be well he's never gonna hold me to any of these things and like sure enough he held me to the letter of the law and every single thing and so he so I decide to do something that we talked about on this uh on this podcast I decided to take him to Petty court and so a lawyer a guy who listened to the Pod who's a lawyer reaches out he's like yo I heard about the landlord thing I'm ready to fight to the death on this for free and I was like let's do this and so in my head I was like I'm gonna fight this 20 grand got this lawyer now he's got Troy you know he's a great dude um got to know him a little bit through this process but we try fighting back we and the problem is I'm going against an 87 year old retired lawyer who's got nothing not my time on his hands he this is probably the biggest thrill he's had in 37 years to fight and be and you know like look up every California statute and he sends me these packets of like 47 documents he sends me CD-ROMs full of photos of the property I'm like dude I don't have a CD player to put this in what about how am I supposed to see these photos and he's just sending me letter after letter and he's I took a guy to Petty Court who is like the king of petty court and in the end I end up paying the full amount just by saying eff it and I'm like because I'm like dude I'm wasting my time I'm wasting this lawyer's time I might say this old guy's time but he's got infinite time and uh he is built for this whereas I should have just wrote this 20K check and just moved on with my life five weeks ago and I knew it because at night when before I was going to sleep I was up I was like oh [ __ ] I didn't respond to that [ __ ] subpoena he sent me basically this like giant package of letters I was like okay I'm gonna call him I'm gonna say this he's gonna say that I was like imagining this whole debate in my head I was like dude what a waste of mental space and once I finally had that realization that I was playing a small boy game by losing my mental like my mental space in my head that could be done used on productive things in order to be in petticort I wrote the check and I moved on with my life dude I think it's worth fighting those things by the way no no it's 100 dude going to war for the sake of war is worth it I had the Sam on my shoulder and I had the Andrew on my shoulder and I listened to the salmon I should have never listened to the Sam I wasted four weeks of my life that's like you're you're like a bull in a china shop and there's this tiny little fly buzzing on you and you just have to ignore it there's a great quote on this that someone said to me once when I was going through something similar and the guy said Never Wrestle a pig you'll both get dirty but the pig will enjoy it yeah that is exactly there's no problem I'm the pig here I'm the pig here what I I had Sean I had the you know my situation yeah I had something like this go on this year too and I texted Andrew I go what do I do and he said the same thing he goes don't wrestle with pigs or whatever this [ __ ] biblical [ __ ] and I bought into it and it eats me it eats me every night that someone that someone got someone I got got you there's what's the Charlie Munger calls it um the rats and The Granary right if you own a granary you have a big Warehouse full of grain there's gonna be rats you can keep killing them over and over again but they're gonna always come back and it's better to just accept that there's rats out there said we got rats at your Granary bro yeah okay let's go to the next one okay cool um all right let's go to the next category let's do we're gonna do breakout company which is sort of the sexy one and then let's do the unsexy business of the year so we'll do we'll do both first let's do the uh the breakout company of the year uh Andrew you want to go first yeah I mean this is so obvious but I and I I came up with a few others but I just I feel like we both want to say the same obvious thing where everyone's gonna say the same eye open AI open AI gpt3 is shocking I think this is like a watershed moment and uh I there's nothing else I haven't seen anything like this in probably 10 years I have two words for you guys that that will change your opinion yeah liver King what this guy called his shot man that's the trooper you're gonna tell me that that dude when you have Elon Musk and Sam Altman and 10 billion dollars that's not a breakout company that's not a breakout that's just that's a company that they are who we thought they were they did exactly what we thought they were gonna do that that doesn't count as a breakup you're saying you expected you expected like when I I remember a friend of mine called me about a month before they released the chat and was like oh my God it's amazing and I kind of rolled my eyes you know I didn't wasn't super excited about it but I have not seen anything this crazy in a very long time I mean obviously Dolly and stuff is insane too but the chat it's just nuts I've actually stopped using Google a lot of the time and started using the chat do well look they you took the nerdiest of nerds the smartest guys on Earth and who gave them 10 billion dollars and he locked him in a room for six years yeah but like if you knew their friends if it was 1945 and you're like what's the breakout project of the year and I'm like it's the Manhattan Project and you're like oh well this got billions of dollars and whatever it's still [ __ ] crazy they made a nuclear bomb it's crazy this is like a nuclear bomb moment it's just like my expectations they met my expectations like If This Were if this were like uh if this was like a second grade report report card it would definitely be like met expectations there would not be there would not be like yeah yeah this is not an exceed I kind of felt like it was a goofy project I was like oh you know Google Apple all these other people they're gonna do this for you know they have a huge incentive profit incentive these guys are going like non-profit when they first started and it's kind of like all about openness and whatever it's morphed into something that I didn't expect and I certainly didn't expect it to do as well as it did given all the star power I think often think about like super groups super groups are usually not that good it was like a super group yeah I mean the Avengers worked out but yeah I feel you I I feel you I mean like in music so Sam yours your your breakout person or company is liver King not AI I mean yeah we're Andrew Tate but yeah one of those guys we did an episode where we detailed the leaked emails from the liver King where he's like yo I'm gonna take a bunch of steroids I'm gonna build this brand and then I'm gonna sell like 100 million dollars worth of products that's what I'm gonna do and then he did it so that's so much more dope all right let me merge the tune so Sam you like the call your shotness Andrew you're like wow open at my Sam Altman you guys have done something magical I'm gonna give you a called shot that I think is kind of unbelievable to be honest with you okay so Paul Graham is going to win my award here for calling it they call your shot moment so back in 2009 Paul Graham wrote a blog post so this is now what like 13 years ago or something like that Paul Graham writes a blog post it's called if you go to paulgram.com Five Founders the number five in the founders he says inc.com recently asked me oh yeah my most interesting Founders are the last 30 years he goes how do you decide who's interesting I think it's influence you know who are the five have influenced me the most who do I use as examples when I'm talking to companies that I'm funding who do I find myself quoting a lot and it's everybody you would expect it's Steve Jobs is number one he's got Larry and Sergey from Google he's got like his buddy but Paul bukite who uh invented Gmail and also wrote the first prototype for AdSense and gave Google the Mantra of don't be evil okay everything's expected so far and number five he says Sam Altman hey guys I was told I shouldn't mention who at the time by the way was 22 I think right yeah exactly at the time he's probably 21 or 22 years old and he was wearing he was wearing double pop neon colors with Steve Jobs exactly very embarrassing put up a photo of him doing this uh uh announcement at the at the Apple conference where he's wearing a double Polo neon popped collar uh it's it's really incredible you wouldn't think that that guy's gonna rule the world but but Paul Graham knew that he would so he's here's what he wrote about Sam Alvin back in 2009 he goes I shouldn't mention a YC founder um but Sam Altman cannot be stopped by flimsy rules if he wants to be on this list he is going to be honestly Sam is along with Steve Jobs the founder I refer to most when I'm advising startups on question of design I asked what would Steve do but on a question of strategy or ambition I ask what would samma do uh when when I learned meeting Sama is that the doctrine applies the doctrine of the elect applies to Startup it applies in a way that that it applies way less than most people think startup investing is not about picking winners you think might win a horse race because there are a few people with such force of will that they are going to get whatever they want and now you fast forward 13 years the guy you know basically creates this you know what's going to be a multi probably a multi-hundred billion dollar Company open Ai and brings you know one of the most magical technical like magical technology experiences which is if you're if you're using dolly or gpt3 he created and he wasn't even that successful back then by the way I don't think he had I think he I think he had sold a company but he sold it was less than they raised I don't think he sold it even at that point so let me see when it was called loot yeah it was loot um and I think they made they sold it for about 43 million dollars he sold it three years later so this was he was at the beginning of loot he sold it for 43 million and uh and I think and I I remember reading about the sale there were some there's some interesting stuff about how he uh like they sold it for less than it than it was funded for right which is like you know considered an L uh but he but he sold it in a way that he was able to pocket a few million bucks he then invested in Airbnb right away and was the first seed investor in Airbnb he's got this like you know he went on kind of an epic run post that um yeah he's a crazy guy I think that's uh that's got to be the breakout is I agree maybe Sam Altman this time can beat the liver King but it's close we could all agree you know tomato tomato the most impressive thing about liver King is he's not a good looking dude like some of these guys you see in their influencers and they're like super jacked and handsome he's not a good looking he's my example when I say I I told sahil Bloom this because saho Bloom is like the good looking version of me I was like hey if I can't be good looking I'm gonna be interesting looking and uh that's what the liver King did he's not good looking but he decided to be really [ __ ] interesting looking and that works just as well uh I then we'll have to go with Sam Altman gets it this time all right let's do unsexy business um oh dude I didn't even know what you meant by that well you go first an unsexy business is like when we do our our blue collie uh blue collar Billy of the week what do we call this [ __ ] the blue collar side hustle uh it's like a business that's not artificial intelligence or flying cars or whatever it's just like a boring unsexy business how are you confused by this this is like the premise of our podcast but I don't know all right well what podcast uh so what's yours all right I'm gonna go with um I could go with uh egg cartons but I think I've kind of beat that one to death the egg cartons.com if you haven't heard me rant about that go look up that episode that is honestly that is the most remarkable one this woman Sarah Moore but if not that I'm gonna go with one we haven't talked about that much on here it's called Aunt Flo have you heard of this business no so what are you saying the word ant I like ant I'm saying flow yeah ant flow okay all right you could say it your way sorry I just wanted to make sure that this the it's the word that we're using okay yeah so I am flow so amp flow is a business that is basically um it's period products I don't know how I'm supposed to say this but for uh it's period products so basically you go to a public restroom inside of any University a stadium whatever in the women's restroom they uh should have and now in many states they are mandating that you have to have you know tampons pads products for women and so um normally these were coming in a Dusty raggedy container uh with like really poor hygiene you gotta like open the thing and everyone's like trying to use toilet paper to like touch the thing to open it and it's like really gross I mean this is like you know there's like literally like blood on these products so it's not not like a very it's not not something that you want to touch it's not a sexy experience and what she did was she brought a sexy experience to a very unsexy industry so if you go look at their dispensers they basically made like the Tesla of of dispensers and they install it on the wall it's got this great brand she's this great founder and they are just cleaning up so they are getting conscious with universities with what and these are multi-year contracts it's installed on the wall this thing is never going to get changed it's gonna be no churn is my prediction and it's sort of like they installed a dispenser and then they have to buy the products as they as they're used or as they run out and um and she calls herself the CEO the chief estrogen officer she's just gone all in on like building this company as a woman-led company that's like making this one kind of crappy experience better and I asked her I was like did you invest in this yeah I was like I've never been in a woman's restroom before uh what's the current like who's the incumbent who are you competing against and she's like literally it's a guy named like a brand called Bob and Rick and like Bob and Rick's dispensers are like the thing and you know it's this terrible experience and we're making it better and so they're at like you know they're definitely at a sort of like high seven figures uh uh run rate where they have all these great contracts and they you know they're they're the official dispenser for all the Apple Stores and for like you know the whole state of you know I don't know Utah or whatever some State that's like mandated this can happen and I think once one state does it all these states are gonna do it so I think they're very well positioned to take a very boring Niche and build a pretty badass business and she's a teal fellow only 25 years old yeah air coder I think her name is that's right that's a good one do you have one Andrew yeah okay so um hotels are constantly trying to save money especially chains and I don't know if you've ever gone to like a hotel chain you'll notice that on the wall if it's like a cheaper one they'll have like dispensers for shampoo and soap and it's all refillable right so the idea is like you used to go to a hotel and there'd be a bar of soap in a box and you open the bar of soap and you use it to clean your ass and then they have to throw it away right so um it's a huge waste they're constantly throwing money away and so hotels have moved to these refillable things but one thing that um they can't do is toilet paper so when you go and there's a full roll of toilet paper and you use some of it you know no one wants to go into a hotel and be like oh what the heck there's like a little bit of toilet paper left there's obviously someone just here who used it and so there's someone I just heard about this business it hasn't launched yet but I thought it was fascinating basically it's a dispenser for toilet paper so it's on it actually embeds in the wall all and you basically pull out almost like you would Kleenex perfectly portion toilet paper and I don't think this would necessarily work at like a Four Seasons or a high-end place but certainly for like a Marriott or a Hilton I think they could save tons of money so I thought that was just incredibly boring and quite interesting that's a great one all right that's a good one there was one that got big doing that with uh with the shampoo bottles back in the day they would take the once used shampoo bottle and they would recycle it basically and they were just like hey Hotel will pay you nothing for it but we'll come collect it for you we'll just take it off your hands because you're just this is just trash for you and they created so have you guys invested in any boring businesses like I you know I give Nick Huber a little bit of money I think you did yeah what else what other boring stuff have you guys done uh I'm in enduring so they buy you know the same kind of boring businesses that's kind of tech I mean like I mean like brick and mortar uh development of real estate like Townhomes I feel like we it's weird because I feel like half of what we talk about on this podcast is like these Boring Brick and Mortar businesses and yet we like and we like fetishize them we don't own that many of them like yeah I own a uh an air uh air ambulance business um I you know I own a deli and bakery a bunch of kind of restaurants and that kind of stuff wait what the but I want to get your ambulance oh like helicopters ambulance so if you're like in Mexico and you need to be brought home and you've you've had a surgery or something we facilitate that um it's a very good business but I really want more of those things have you guys ever thought about like starting like a fund around that or something because I feel like it's a lot of words yeah I like to visit I don't really live there we don't have to operate you don't have to operate us just invest in all these cash flowing boring businesses I I whenever people talk about that I'm like where do you find that like like you're going to eBay like where do you like where do you find this air ambulance thing you know what I mean yeah it was like we had to we met someone through a friend of a friend it's always like someone's dad right it's like oh you know his his dad wants to retire and the kids don't want the business or something like that or these things happen at the golf course yeah I don't know yeah I should be doing that I I think I got like really Tech brainwashed because I basically I started a sushi restaurant then I moved to Australia and did like a biotech thing but then I moved to Silicon Valley when I was 24 and I was like basically I just got like really deep in the Silicon Valley kind of ethos and game and that was my that's my network and that's my my skills were around internet companies and so I think it was kind of the right move to go deep there and try to like win in that World um because I think you don't have to win in all games so like you know I have a fun to do startup investing like if I do good with if I do great with startup investing I'll do great I don't really need to also do great with a very different style of investing so I think I'm curious about it but um you know do I want to like sort of restart the learning curve in a new way but one you know you guys have this crazy advantage of you know I think your your rolling fund as well because of the podcast right so if you guys go on and you say hey who has a Granddad or a father or a mother who owns this family business that wants to sell I feel like you'd get mobbed there's something let's see all right Sean at seanpuri.com all those leads can go to me then if you guys don't want let's let's see what comes in I'll share all the interesting I'll filter all the interesting ones uh for you Andrew so Sean at seanpuri.com email me your your dad your granddad your uncle's business that we could either take like a minority stake or maybe he's looking to retire itself let's see let's see what we got um okay so those are the ones um dude you know I I did it but I I was reading about coffeezilla going deep on Andrew Tate's thing do you guys know how Andrew Tate makes money I do but go ahead he basically he has this well okay fine you got that smug look on your face it's like a cam girl's business right like it's a definition of a sexy person no no the real way to make money is yeah he's got this [ __ ] Discord that's 50 a month in order to like join and there's like channels on like copywriting it's basically just the same [ __ ] that you and I Sean have done like screwing around except do you know how big it is it's like tens of 150 million yeah no no no no no no like a million members oh wow like we're talking nine figures in revenue and coffee Zilla like did it he's like look here's all the members if you multiply that by 50 and then you can even add a discount to it it's like we're talking about north of 100 million in revenue and it's just a Discord with voluntary with volunteer community like chairs like Community leads freaking crazy and uh I considered saying for breakout person but I you know he's obviously pretty controversial so I didn't want to like I'm the breakout is I've never seen somebody go from nobody to everywhere all the time in your face the way this guy has like he built a crazy in like seven months or something like that like had you ever heard this word before Andrew Tate last year like no no I think he was the most Googled person on Earth this year that's crazy to me is that crazy and he says it and when he when he does his interviews he goes he goes Mr Beast has to spend five million dollars and blow up blow up a bus in order to get 10 million views I said I said I just talk yeah and it's true it's true the guy's way of speaking and the the things he says are so compelling and then he built this viral engine where his all hustles University is is basically yo post cut cut up clips of Tate everywhere and then go comment and basically in the comments Revere me and that's how you know and then everybody who signs up for the professor University you're gonna make money doing that like that's basically the core job is like go promote me um it's crazy it's insane it is crazy it's a multi-level marketing scheme just promoting him he is the product it's wild all right so what's uh do we vote on that one or just move to a different topic uh yeah vote okay let's do our best investment so the best investment you made and then we're gonna do worst investment also so let's start with uh let's start with best investment let's go Sam what was the best investment you made 2022 financially [ __ ] none this year was in terms of money this was horrible uh the two best uh Investments I made were getting Fitness coaches so nutritionists and and like a lifting coach a fitness coach and then also this pod this is like the first time Sean this year where like and this is actually one of my most proud moments where I've been walking around and I get noticed maybe one to three times a day and this is the first time that I'm like oh wow Sean the work that you and I have done over four or five hundred episodes it's like properly paid off yeah so that's this part is this this year it felt different has it ever has ever been annoying or yeah one time like it's there's been multiple times where Sarah and I are having like a serious conversation or we're arguing or we're having like a contentious conversation and someone pops up and like you gotta like like oh hey yeah hi hi yeah you gotta like turn it on and that kind of sucks it's like you know like when you and your wife get in a fight but then you got to get in the car together to go to like your friend's house for dinner and you gotta put on like the performance of the century that's kind of like how it feels sometimes there's a there's a uh what's her name from The Hunger Games Jennifer Lawrence her name Lawrence she talked about how she can be nice to a thousand people but if one time she's fighting with her boyfriend and she's kind of a [ __ ] to somebody they'll go on Reddit and post about it and she feels like you basically always have to be that person and it's only a matter of time until you snap knowing you it's only a matter of time one time we are at um you know we're we're exploring the pregnancy thing this year and one time we were at the baby baby doctors and someone in the waiting room said something to me and uh I was I was I didn't I was rude apology there all right I'll do a quick one okay so best financial investment I invest in this company called triple will that's basically like a uh it's a tool for Shopify store owner so it helps you like see your dashboard and uh make sure your ads are working well and they have like a bunch of different features I invest in this thing because I I was like oh I like this I want to use this for my Ecom store maybe I should just invest in it really didn't think this was gonna I thought if and I did this by the way I took my portfolio and I ranked like what do I think are going to be the breakouts and what do I think are least likely to be the breakouts because I I suspected I might be surprised I was very surprised so us I think our 75 000 investment in triple whale is currently worth 3.3 million and so uh that's been the the biggest breakout from the fund so far and it's would have been one of the five that I did not guess would be this explosive rocket ship because like that's just not how I thought about it back then like when I saw it it looked like this cool Analytics tool for Ecom you know Shopify stores I don't know how big that is I don't know how fast it'll grow it's been insane so that's my financial one and then I'll also say um we did Camp MFM and that was an amazing investment I'll tell you a little little story about it so we did this camp 20 30 people we go to North Carolina and we fly in this NBA trainer so we pay for his kind of him and his buddy like they're they're uh fights at hotels or whatever we rent these airbnbs we do the camp it's great everybody chipped in I think like a thousand bucks or 1500 bucks two grand or something yeah I thought I thought that would cover the cost didn't quite cover it I think we're in the whole like 15 grand or something like that no problem uh amazing experience just for the basketball all the fun meeting people all that good stuff but something kind of crazy happened um we tweeted out that we were hanging with Mr Beast or something like that or that uh that maybe the Pod we recorded with Mr Beast and a guy saw that started following Ben Levy Ben Levy then checks out this guy's profile um oh this guy's in the crypto space DM's him oh let's talk you know maybe they'll advertise with us we end up getting an acquisition offer from this person that's not the deal we ended up going with but it gave us the leverage in the deal we did end up going with uh and like opened this door into acquisition and it's all like if we hadn't tweeted out that thing that we were doing with Mr Beast I don't think this person would have followed and then I don't think that conversation would happen and so the world Works in these really funny ways where this like kind of amazing acquisition we had this year I don't know they could have just as easily not happened or been for a lot less had we not like just done this totally unrelated thing that's good good things happen because it's great all right Andrew what you got best investment so Mine mine's actually an investment I made a couple years ago but it's taken a while to play out and it's very small um but I really like this one so um you guys know Sophia Amoroso I think she's been on the podcast before um I met Sophia like five or six years ago and she just had the experience with nasty gal and she's like I'm trying to figure out what to do next I've written this book called girl boss and I've kind of built this community around it this social following I want to turn it into a business and I said like look you know I think you should bootstrap this but she got mobbed with uh VCS and so it was easy money great valuation raised like 10 million bucks or something and because she took VC money she had this really wonderful business but she had to turn into a billion dollar thing and this is girl so suddenly this is girl boss and so she uh you know raised all this money and she's like I'm gonna build basically like LinkedIn slash like a social network for female entrepreneurs to connect them which we all know is like the world's biggest lift it's like oh my most impossible to start a social network and so she ended up running out of cash getting exhausted she sold it to attention capital and they basically were just like [ __ ] we don't know what to do about this like we we shouldn't have bought this and so they reached out to us and we were able to buy it for a really really cheap just because the business was totally distressed um and so you know we looked at it and we're like okay like let's just go back to basics this business has almost 2 million social followers and email subscribers and we just did basic stuff we built a daily email newsletter we sold ads we did social ads we did affiliate we rebooted the podcast brought on a great CEO and it's just been this phenomenal base hit and I just got an update from our CEO uh Lulu who's like freaking amazing and basically now the business is I won't say numbers but it's making as much as we paid for it every year in profit and I think it's probably 5 or 10x more valuable than what we paid for it at least um so I I just love that kind of stuff where we're able to take a business that shouldn't have raised venture or you know kind of failed in Venture Land and actually make it a sustainable business that'll be going for five or ten years at least that's crazy yeah that's really cool I like those and I think there's gonna be a bunch of those Venture businesses that fail that's another one if you're a venture business and you're not gonna be able to raise the next round because the whole Market is turned or whatever uh it's not over and there's like a way to structure these deals I think most Founders just throw in the towel don't know what to do with that asset but uh again there's a lot there's a lot of these businesses where you let's say a business gets to five or ten million dollars of Revenue and they're burning you know a million two million a month because they're like Venture backed or whatever to the founder you know they're just like okay well this is worth nothing you know let's go sell to Facebook and we'll take it Aqua hire and they actually will throw out their existing business that business has value and people like us and enduring will buy it and turn it around and make you know make it into something that'll actually make them proud um so yeah I mean it's it all is not like enduring to that with up Council that's what that was the example totally can we um we gotta do worship my worst one is a personal real estate like I bought real estate over the last two years and I'm in I'm made money on on all of it so far and like technically speaking like it's all like gonna beat the stock market well that's easy because the stock market sucks but like some of my investment it's like my Airbnb it's still like a eight percent return or something like that but it's just a [ __ ] headache dude I regret buying real estate I wish I didn't own any real estate and I wish I just invested in other people's funds yeah that's my worst investment it just it's caused me a dispersional amount of headache yeah that's a good one uh all right mine is uh mine's really hard to choose so many losers to choose from this year so uh so people know my portfolio is essentially tech stocks and crypto um tech stocks down somewhere between 40 and 85 percent this year crypto down 75 percent this year or sometimes 100 in certain cases uh I think Luna has to be my pick because it went to zero um and so that was just like you know what a 100 loss that happened in like three days so last year this episode last year here's here's Sean's company to watch Tara slash Luna that was his answer I said company to watch and it sure did give you some entertainment yeah you want you watched it go down and then his prediction was that the Winkle VI twins the the Winklevoss twins are gonna be richer than Zuckerberg so that is a long-term prediction but you you bet on Luna so so you're gonna double down this is the question are you gonna double down on your winkle VI prediction and what's the timeline and what's the punishment if you lose no no these are supposed to be crazy predictions these are not supposed to be things I think are going to happen they're sort of like far-fetched predictions no I don't I don't want to double down on that I would say that's looking way less likely now than it did then um but you know it's basically like a Facebook stock got crushed a little bit this year too I I had calculated that I think I forgot what it is now but I think Bitcoin would have needed to be at if Bitcoin got to 2 million dollars a coin then the Winkle and Facebook had like you know uh you know kept his value or something like that based on how much Bitcoin they owned I thought okay at that point they all have surpassed uh a suit but the Hedge was always if Zucker owns any Bitcoin then they can really never pass him um you know if he put a minority stake in but I don't think Zuck cares if the wake of fire are rich or not I I don't think that's a concern of his so what's what's yours Andrew um so mine is really just Venture in general so we I've been doing Angel Investing For 10 plus years and I think I've done well um on a cash basis I've got a lot of money back but I haven't actually like if I think about it um even if I've made 15 to 30 a year I haven't had access to that cash the entire time whereas in my main business when I buy a business and I make you know make 20 or 30 return I'm actually getting that cash and I'm compounding it and then I'm investing it and doing more and more and more and I think psychologically there's a big difference between owning a whole bunch of businesses and doing 50 million dollars in ebitda versus uh owning a bunch of stakes that are a liquid and a bunch of venture businesses where maybe you'll get your money in 10 to 15 years and so I don't think that it's necessarily saying I don't want to invest in Venture go forward but it's just been I think it's been a bad if I think of it as if my goal is to maximize my capital and feel rich it's not the best way to do that I think that I'm much better off incubating businesses and uh buying businesses because it's a very steady 15 to 30 percent cash return and I feel it I feel the win in a much bigger way and I think that like anyone over the last two years there's some businesses where I look at the valuation I invested at and I I knew it at the time I sucked it up and was like [ __ ] you know this is just the world we're in but there's some businesses with like now maybe like four million dollars of Revenue and they raised it like 100 million dollar valuation and I'm just like okay that's just gone yeah well that sucks we all just we all just said horrible things that we did this year I don't know just just bask in the uh in the in the hill Look At You Know You're Gonna you can't you can't have a non-error right you know like you can't be an investor and not have a portfolio of bad Investments of bad decisions right like that is there's not really a thing if you're gonna do this uh and you're gonna take you know the appropriate amount of risk that would get a reward you can't have a zero percent error rate and so I don't think it's anything to be shy of also you know I think a lot of people you know are have portfolios that are down this year just by the nature of like what's going on in the market there's that uh there's that logic brain coming in to save you yeah I know I mean that but that's like a that's where the logic brain is actually like useful all right like I learned this in poker too like you oh I had pocket aces and I lost I literally know people that will fold pocket queens or something like that in poker why because they're traumatized from the bad beat they got one time and there are Jacks I hate Jacks like you what do you mean you hate pocket Jacks why um like why don't you you know just because you got your money in good but it turned out not the way you wanted like you know being able to assess the decision and not the result is so key what I when I'm making fun of myself for for fomoing into Investments it's because I think my decision was bad sure the result was bad but my decision was bad I have many Investments where I think the decision is good and the result might be bad for a period of time that's okay uh but being able to separate the twos is super important I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better um Sam what topic you want to go to which category dude I want to combine book of the year and favorite podcasts or news person newsletter or person you subscribe to so I want to like we'll do a few actionable things like best things that we um yeah like best bit bits of content mine for a favorite person I sort of favorite person is it's two you already named one of them Paul Graham dude Paul Graham is such a beautiful writer I started reading all of his work again this year he's such an awesome writer he talks about money living happiness raising a family he's a really good writer I love reading him the other one is cultural tutor do you guys know who cultural tutor is on Twitter never heard of it so it's this person um who I don't think they're crazy popular but I'm going to give you an example of a thing that they tweeted so it's called It's called The the cultural tutor a beautiful education that's their thing and so they'll do like posts about like um uh I'll I'll let me find a good one but it's all about culture so basically right now uh minimalism is a thing so if you look at like a lot of new buildings minimalism is a thing and the cultural tutor will do this thread saying uh this is actually pretty lame about this architecture it's pretty boring here's the ornate stuff that we used to do and here's why we used to do it and here's why we do minimalism now and it makes you like question uh certain things that we're doing or another one could be um um here's like a famous uh piece of art and it was actually revolutionary uh and here's or here's why Mona Lisa here's why it looks like her eyes are following you and this doesn't seem interesting now but it was interesting because back then here's how they used to do things and here's what was actually revolutionary about that painting things like that I love the cultural tutor it's a really good follow that's a good one um you said you were gonna combine that with book of the year book of the Year Blitz have you ever read Blitz Andrew it's about the story of drug use during World War II I mean you you've got meth and you've got Hitler I mean what could go wrong it's a frame breaking book basically the whole hypothesis was that during World War II you know how like they gave soldiers like pieces of chocolate and cigarettes to keep them happy well and in Nazi Germany era they gave them meth and one of the one of the reasons it says Hitler was being crazy and making a lot of the decisions that he did not only was he like a hateful crazy person but they're saying it was also because he was on meth the whole time and he was going nutty and one of the reasons why he killed himself was he basically ran out of drugs in the last two weeks in his bunker what do you got there Sean is that Blitz right there no this is that place I'm looking at the book I think I'm gonna choose but Andrew go go next so my favorite podcast I'm absolutely obsessed with Founders which is by David senra and what he basically does is he reads business biographies um and then he summarizes them really really well so there's a lot of I've read a lot of business biographies I really enjoy them but there's a lot of them where I'm like I just I'm not gonna spend 15 hours of my life learning about JFK's dad right there's this there's there's always books on my bookshelf that taunt me and so I read that book He's a patriarchy yeah I read about a quarter of it it was great but but um he he'll do like the one one and a half hour summary and so a it's a great way to remind yourself like I I read Titan a couple years ago about John D Rockefeller and I re-listened to it it reminded me of a lot of the lessons and then B it'll actually tell me do I want to read this book is this person actually interesting or just give me a cursory understanding of that person so I absolutely love that one in terms of books the one that I loved over the last year is the operator which is about David Geffen the guy is a absolute lunatic it's fascinating like the picture of him um you know why is he the way he is deep dive on him started he started records I mean this guy this guy was like um he's touched so many Industries you know huge musicians too at this point like yeah I mean yeah fascinating career but also an incredible investor um and capital allocator and stuff but what a fascinating book and it's one of those ones where it's very unflattering but it's incredible okay that's worth like five or ten billion dollars at this point I mean he's like a big deal all right I'll do um book I'm gonna have I got two two picks that I thought were good uh I only read probably three or four books this year but uh this one so think on these things by krishnamurthy that's like a uh life philosophy book that uh bro I love you said that was your favorite book one time and I asked you how far into the book you've read and you said you're on the first three pages yeah actually uh I'm only about 30 pages in now uh so I've gone from three to Thirty in a year I think it might have been my pick last year too um this book is so heavy man it's got like uh let me see how far dude it's not okay it's like 250 Pages 110 pages in um so some 110 pages in and uh it's it's an amazing book the second one is uh Andrew you probably read this richer wiser happier it's a great book for anybody who likes investing um and basically yeah there's a great book for anybody who likes investing I think it's a it's a it's a fun read so uh those are my two favorite books that I read this year and then podcast newsletter or person I'm gonna give two kind of shout outs a person one that's a little under the radar is called 10K diver if you follow this guy on Twitter so yeah the 10K diver the bio just it's the literally it's a number 10 then K diver uh it says I help people understand the fundamentals of finance and investing and um I think it's called 10K diver because it's like the form 10K like the the that's like the the name of the form or whatever so uh he just gives really great threads about like very basic fundamentals of Finance and I find myself reading these and thinking oh surely I know you know about whatever topic it is certainly I know about stock based compensation certainly I know you know whatever cash flow and then you read it and you're like I always learn something from it and I think he's a great writer he's very clear he's very helpful um I just think it's a great great one to follow it's like you know there's a lot of junk food on Twitter and I would say that 10K diver is not junk food I even took his like Maven course um but did you really I I only attended like half of the sessions just because like you know it's hard to make that much time um super interesting dude and uh and you know I I don't know the course wasn't like mind breaking for me but um I don't know it's it's all good stuff it's all good stuff and so I really I really liked uh I really like the way this guy thinks um okay so that's the the person one and okay book so I did book all right we're good we're good on those we all all three did ours yeah all right cool yeah what uh what topic you want to do next wild predictions okay what you got mine's easy I think by the way you want me to read your wild predictions from last year should I read our predictions yeah all right our predictions from last year Sams was um San Francisco is going to be cool again San Francisco will be cool again you think you hit that or no no but I don't think I'm I I I'm I early I'm not off my prediction but I'm but yeah I'm a little early it's gonna come back man because Sanford I went back there it is awesome San Francisco is awesome yeah you said something about the YouTuber meet Kevin and that uh he will be like and his company's gonna break out or something like that I don't know what that prediction was oh yeah I totally was wrong uh totally at home Diagnostics you said was the industry to watch yeah nothing happened there and then you said overrated the Creator economy slash web3 nailed it yeah I emailed that one um Andrew your predictions were that high and high salary inflation is not here to stay companies are going to Outsource an offshore um Talent what do you think about that one I still think it's right I think that it just took I think we're just seeing it now basically as these Tech layoffs happen I think they're going to go globally right um and then you said overrated you said nfts um I think we I think we structured this differently last time we did like companies to watch overrated thing to watch I said overrated with spax I think that was right um I said a company to watch Tara Luna that was way wrong and my crazy prediction was that the book of I will end up richer than Zuck which is you know early like we already talked about okay so this year what do you got for a prediction or predictions for 2023 so we structured it differently but let me say my mine too because they're fast one Elon Musk either dies or he or he gets canceled or he gets canceled in an incredibly like serious way and Tesla stock completely tanks the second thing is so open eye open AI um something involving regulations gonna happen because like there's already been little bits of pieces like if you Google or if you use open Ai and you ask them about coal they say like you know we think that climate change is wrong yada yada or if you ask them about uh race um they say something like you know race is a social and cultural construct and you we don't we don't want to give it our opinion on this like they kind of like but they actually do insert their opinion um and I think that there's gonna be some weird [ __ ] going on where like right now like like for example they'll like say like hey we'll give you a hundred thousand dollars for 10 of your company if you build on top of our platform and there should be all these new tools but it's all going to be underlined with this like potential massive bias that open AI has and I think there's got to be some type of Regulation around it do you know what I mean yeah Andrew what you got predictions and by the way these are supposed to be when we said we said wild predictions so we're again we're not saying we're sure these are going to happen these are like sort of interesting predictions yes you remember like five years ago everyone was saying Apple doesn't innovate anymore they can't do Ai and what was happening is that Google at least historically has innovated in public so they're constantly constantly releasing new features and showing off these kind of half-baked ideas that are in their r d Labs whereas Apple has always been very opaque they'll work on something for seven years they won't share it and then all of a sudden they'll release it and I think that same thing is happening with gpt3 and AI I do believe that while right now I can say I'm using gpt3 instead of Google I think Google has probably been working on something similar for years and years and years and is probably very far ahead maybe not ahead of gpt3 necessarily but that they have their own offering and so I just think it's a those there's going to be a lot of a lot of other players in that space coming out over the next probably three to six months and that it will be there's going to be an ecosystem of offerings similar to AWS and Azure and Google Cloud I think it'll be the same thing with gpt3 Google maybe Microsoft I don't know who else cool um Sam I agree with your Elon one that's one of my predictions I think he gets canceled in a big way or one of his companies goes broke I think that is a a good wild prediction um but I'm actually not going to predict I think that yeah he he's gonna get me too'd I think yeah I feel like he already has and somehow in me already I mean he already did I mean yeah kind of I think he's uncancelable kind of given all this stuff I think people think that and then it's gonna get the number of things still gonna happen I think he's gonna They're Gonna Cancel the uncancelable um but I'm not really going to predict anything that's like the macro because a who the hell knows and B who the hell cares I'm actually going to take a page out of out of the book of uh of something we respect highly here on MFM call on your own shot so my predictions are about myself so here's my here's my predictions about myself uh I predict that this is the year that I get ripped uh I predict that I turned the corner and and not like oh I get back in shape no your boy's never been in this kind of shape so I'm gonna get ripped for the first time and uh I also believe that I'm gonna start a company that is um special I don't I don't want to put a dollar amount because these special things take time so it's not going to happen in one year but I'm gonna do I'm gonna start the thing that will be my kind of like um the thing I'm known for for a very long time the Legacy thing or the thing that you know builds the the big the big wealth the big Empire I think it's gonna happen this year so those are my predictions uh for myself for 2023 well I'm happy you called your shot I actually agree with you I think you're gonna do that too I think you're you're more than likely gonna create that company than you are get ripped but uh you're just giving me that fuel thank you for the fuel are you willing to take drugs to get ripped no I'm all natural you're unwilling to take drugs I like the liver King uh okay well then yeah then I think that you're well dude getting ripped is hard man I'm I'm pretty ripped right now and everyone keeps asking me what I did and you know what I did I just didn't eat and it's really really a pain in the butt I don't really like doing it and so I don't know like I don't think you need to be that ripped what's your definition of ripped I guess visible abs yeah you got to get to what is it 12 body fat 12 it's not you can be you can live a good life and be at 12 but below 10 where I am trying to get it it sucks I'm just hungry and cold yeah I'm not gonna do that but it'll be visible all right um let's do another one uh coolest moment of the year for you what was the coolest moment of the year uh personally that you had dude mine is like it kind of felt like we crossed a Chasm for like kind of like this podcast being well known and like that's a little I didn't want to do a selfish one honestly I almost feel free yeah I almost I wanted to say you selling the milk Road I actually did think that was cool um uh the the seeing you do that I got a lot of joy out of and a lot of like even though I wasn't involved it was like I felt a sense of pride of like we came together the advisor so you know you were involved yeah so feel free to send me some money but uh uh no I think like us getting popular this year like it really felt like this is the first time it happened I agree uh it's something has changed Andrew what about you coolest moment of the year for you so I've talked about this before but I feel like what I actually if I really am honest what I like about business aside from making money and not making my life easier is meeting interesting people and uh you know I got to know uh Andrew huberman this year and we ended up partnering so basically like I've got a foundation I've been giving a bunch of money away to science and so I met huberman maybe is that who you wrote the channel or two ago you wrote the check to science yeah yeah exactly just science but um I met huberman like a year or two ago and basically we did this thing where when people subscribed to his premium podcast a bunch of the money goes to um basically funding science and research that he wants to fund and I basically said look I'll double I'll double every single dollar that you donate and so we've got this partnership and I just love that kind of stuff where would you I can work with some people I respect benefactor do something that I think is good so that's a cool moment you've become a benefactor you get to use one of these words that's like from the 1800s when you do things like that yeah it feels good it's fun dude and plus you have an excuse now to hang out with the dreamiest guy on Earth Andrew huberman yeah totally say I'm jealous anytime you want um for sure all right my coolest moment of the year was you were there for this Sam when we were at Camp MFM and we got to go do a tour of uh of Duke's uh basketball stadium and we're in there and then we uh we're sitting down gave they gave us the talk it was an art it was a good experience at that point but we had a there's a moment that made it a good experience to like a keystone memory which was when I bet Mr Beast ten thousand dollars that I could hit a shot from half court and I hit it and the whole thing on number on number five or something yeah like the third third attempt hit I was like I'll again hit this before you the third attempt I hit it it's on camera it was it was an amazing fun moment it made that that trip a little bit more more special and memorable did he ever pay you this is where it comes this is where it gets interesting it's also actually my biggest L of the year because he didn't pay me and then I had to follow up and I followed up two times three times and now I'm basically begging for the money by the third time you go from like first time you kind of crack it you're busting balls a little bit like hey [ __ ] baby and then the second time you're like hey man uh didn't pay by the time it's the third one now this awesome dope moment has turned into an L because now I'm having to go yeah I think I think I think you need to take him to small claims exactly that's how I'm doing that via iMessage and I was like we have it on video we have the bed up dude we have the bet on video no I know and so this this baller moment of confidence of being like hey betcha 10 grand I can hit the shot and then actually hitting it uh with you know everybody there in the center of you know cameras Cameron Stadium Cameron Indoor Stadium turned into a bit of a small boy moment of being like hey hey um hey did you have a chance to hey just I know you're busy just uh do you think you can I'll send the details again maybe maybe it's on my end dude is he lying about every other uh donation he's ever no coffeezilla get on it are there thousands of victims like me that's crazy I can't believe you didn't pay you he doesn't seem like someone who would he blamed his assistant he's like oh [ __ ] sorry my assistant I'm gonna uh I'm gonna have to yell at him yeah right okay let's do um let's do the craziest most delusional person of the year that we met this one's for for us it's probably easy it's Billy McFarland did you hear that oh did you hear that interview Sean or uh Andrew no I did I didn't hear it I don't like when you guys interview people like that because I I know I know it's like interesting and stuff but I feel like if you if only even if only five percent of people hear that and go hey he actually sounds like a good guy I just think like he's gonna go and [ __ ] more people over I don't know what do you guys think I I didn't and uh we do those bad things he goes and listens to all in instead he doesn't listen to the episode he goes on strike Sean Hall hardly disagrees with you I think yeah I totally disagree I think uh you know this podcast is our vehicle to have conversations with interesting people and everybody's an adult they should judge for themselves whether they think this person's full of [ __ ] or deserves a second chance or whatever on the Pod itself he told us what he was doing and literally with a one pause I just go that's a horrible idea and I actually felt bad that I was that brutal about it uh but it really was I thought a horrible idea and I felt the need to just like say it so um I think it's one thing if you invite them on and they just like like I see this sometimes people just like suck up to people and the other is to be like dude what the hell were you thinking or they're like oh you know I just thought this like are you serious like really you like are you gonna look at me with a straight face and say that this was all just an honest mistake like you had to have known right so I think as long as you are real with your questions uh then it's all good but that's my you know it's my opinion I just think I just think it's like um it's giving air time to people that are bad right like I would say Billy McFarland is probably a psychopath right but the Bernie mate obviously documentary on Netflix coming out in three days are you gonna watch that Bernie Madoff is dead if I if you had if you had Bernie Madoff on your podcast and you were like hey so like what happened tell us your story and even if you kind of call him out if he's like a belief like a real psychopath is like pretty charming and like believable and you listen to them and there's going to be a percentage of people that hear that and the difference with Madoff is he's in jail right the then like Billy McFarland again I have no idea you know he he served his time sure but like he's probably gonna go on and do more sketchy [ __ ] or I don't know any of these people who have a pattern of behavior of doing Psychopathic fraudulent stuff I just don't think they should get any air time frankly yeah okay fair enough I think there's a lot of people who would agree with you uh I don't personally but most most probably do but I actually I'm partially on Sean's side I am mostly on Sean's side but I I do feel guilt sometimes like there's another person who Sean wants to have on that I think there's not a chance we should uh but uh so imagine here's here's how I would tell you to think about this like imagine that you so you know Sam you've told me stories of guys who I remember you told me there was some average Advertiser who is [ __ ] you over and not paying you and you felt very cheated and Sean I mean that guy that you sued who you felt like was chiseling you the landlord or whatever now let's say I have a podcast and I say well there's two sides to every story and he's fascinating I'm gonna go have that guy on my podcast as the victim you'd be like what the [ __ ] that question I would say ask that question as long as you actually ask the questions and you uh you're not just giving them like a chance to lie or say BS in a way that's like it's obviously BS but you let them skate on it um like that's what happened with like Sam bakeries yeah but look at look at Tai Lopez look at Tai Lopez Tai Lopez got legitimized by being on MFM a lot of people heard him and went you know what he's not a bad guy and you know Sam kind of likes him and whatever and like what has he been doing over the last wait wait wait what did I do I didn't do anything you said you're you were like yeah I met him I met him in a hotel and he was actually a really nice guy right and it's like of course he is he's just is charming I like everyone I like to respect the audience and meaning I believe that it you should have the opportunity to hear it and make your own decision I don't pretend that I'm your parent and I'm legitimizing them or I'm telling you they're good or bad or whatever I'm just letting you see them and if you see them and you decide that they're great great if you decide that we didn't ask tough questions and you can't make a decision but Andrew you promote uh you promote Bill Ackman sure like I absolutely do he's my business person and I'm not saying I actually don't know all the details how could you put them in the same category well a lot of I'm not saying I do but a lot of people do don't they Andrew like that's objective you can actually you can at least say that like a lot of people do think that he's uh what did Bill actually do that's on on considered controversy oh yeah what did he do exactly that would be like fraudulent or something like that always made some Investments that have turned out badly but he's never I don't think he's predatory in any way I think Bill is a great individualism I've seen the person you know legitimate is when he went on what's the MLM and he was like I uh the whole markets he basically was like hell is coming blah blah but didn't disclose it he had basically a giant short position yeah maybe caused a panic maybe didn't no but he he had already if he actually look he wrote a letter about this he'd already sold almost his entire position he had like one or two percent left and I spoke to Bill two weeks before that and he was freaking the [ __ ] out like similar benefit greatly if people started selling right he had a giant no sure no he actually made a bunch of money he wasn't no no no no that I think it's a big misunderstanding if you actually look at the Timeline he'd already sold out of that position what about uh Herbalife Herbalife I mean Herbalife he went out and he said this is a multi-level marketing scheme and what ended up happening is the FTC investigated it and they gave them a 200 million dollar fine and they got up to the point of saying hey is this an ml they settled with them for like 200 million it was the largest uh FTC fine ever and Herbalife the FTC commissioner was asked is Herbalife a multi-level marketing pyramid scheme and she said it's not not one right because she was legally Bound by not calling it that so basically bill was right and that was an instance where he lost a shitload of money trying to fight a bad guy did that really happen by the way I'm not saying Bill Ackman sucks I think I'm I'm I like Bill but you're not I know no that's not that's not what I'm applying I'm I'm saying that some people maybe think that he's full of it right I I think yes absolutely there's people that are critical I think there's a great quote on this I'm not saying he is the tallest the tallest blade of grass is the first to get cut and I think Bill is very loud and he is always confident and he's usually right but not always and so someone like that I think when they're not right everyone loves to [ __ ] all over them yeah yeah I'm not saying that I don't think he's in the category where he's got like you know there I don't know of any accusations about stuff like that I think some people are just like he's not as good he loses money he's not as good if an investor as he says or his his Fame would lead you to believe that's a criticism but that's like any that's like that's like criticizing someone's Skittle LeBron James is not as good as Michael Jordan or whatever right like that's different than saying somebody is you know I think it's like it's like fixating on Warren Buffett buying Dexter's shoe and it not working out and then saying or you know Warren Buffett did some deals in his early career where he bought a business and he ended up having to lay a lot of people off right now you could build a narrative that well Warren but everyone says Warren Buffett's so great but what about this and what about this but if you look at it and there's a hundred Investments and 10 of them didn't go well you know you can fixate on the 10 but you can look at the long-term performance bills compounded at 20 plus percent I think 25 or something crazy uh maybe not quite that but something exceptional so again like he's my business partner obviously I'll defend him I'm not by the way yeah I don't think he's anywhere are near those guys I'm not saying I'm not saying I think he sucks I actually like him a lot from what I read about him I'm just saying my point being is a lot of people a lot of awesome people have haters and just because you have a lot of haters doesn't necessarily mean I don't think you should we shouldn't have you on that's my whole point but imagine okay you guys have a newspaper right effectively you guys own the New York Times of tech startup Bros right like that that's what that's what MFM is you guys have this huge audio quote you on that would it be ethical for the editor editor of the New York Times to put an op-ed from Bernie Madoff on the front cover right it was not an op-ed it's an interview it's a big big difference again I hear I totally I totally agree I hear you guys I know you want to like stir the pot and it's good good listening I just for me like I just hate when these weasels get okay let's get back yeah let's move on all right Andrew who's the most delusional person you've met this year so okay so it's a delusional person who I think is amazing um you guys probably will say the same person it's Brian Johnson uh I met Brian almost a year ago and I remember sitting down with him and looking just looking at him he's like a translucent glowing Twilight vampire like he just looks if you cut his arm off there's circuits under there I and he's so incredibly well spoken and like like you I Sam I think you said he's like the the Elon but like behind the scenes and quiet right it's special I think he's amazing uh I think he's like he's like dedicating his life to basically being a test uh you know a test case for the rest of us so I really admire him uh and I think he's really how do you look in person did he look uh on our pot he almost looked he almost looked a little ill like he was so skinny yeah he was so pale that there was no pigment in his skin like literally like literally looked like um what's that movie uh with the [ __ ] what is it uh the robot guy alien alien with the robot guy like just totally pale humanoid that's uh that's my pick too uh Brian Johnson for the for the exact same reason so we'll we'll move to the next one uh he was he was you're right crazy and delusional in the best way possible um yeah as a mean that as a compliment um okay did you guys have another category that you really like your answer for does anybody like think they got something good because we can just go to those the the relationship hacks and the um what you got so um they always say like the best first date is an adrenaline kind of event right so like you want to go on a hike you want to get your heart pounding maybe you go and do like a ropes you know those uh what are they called they're like rope swings through the forest whatever like something that gets your heart pounding because when someone Associates you with a peak experience like a physical feeling of peak experience that's very positive and it bonds you and the same thing is true with alcohol so I I kind of stopped drinking um maybe like seven or eight years ago and I've kind of mourned the ability to go and you know down a pint with someone because they always end up telling you everything they tell you about their business and the problems they're having and you know what's going on with their wife it's like hang out once drunk is like hanging out 10 times times sober and so what I've been doing is I've been been inviting people that I would otherwise have like a meeting with over to my house and we'll do a really long sauna and a cold plunge and I've been finding like I just feel so incredibly bonded to people because I'm having like my body is pumped full of all these endogenous drugs uh and it's been really good it's been kind of like drinking with someone dude can I tell you what mine was here's I'm gonna read let me word re read it word for word invite people have them come over for dinner and cook for them and we take ice baths together after dinner before dinner what are you doing before do you tell them some trucks or how do you prepare are you just spray it on them or or sometimes sometimes they're just spraying on them and I have a towel already and I have shorts and it's so funny that that's exactly what mine is another relationship hack that I have is I bring my wife to almost everything so so it feels like a family a gathering and also she's like like hot and like well like well read and like can have a discussion so it automatically makes me seem better you're the guy with the hot book smart wife oh yeah I bet uh uh yeah so Adrian I had the same thing another thing that I that I typically don't do and I and I think this is the worst way to hang out is while exercising I hate when people say let's go get a workout together I'm like I don't want to I never want to do that ever I will never do a workout and hang out yeah I want silence same I'm the opposite I love love a workout together that's a great it's a great idea I've had multiple listeners from the Pod be like hey I'm in town uh winter workout like I'll just come swing by and we'll just do it together and I was like oh that's perfect I don't want to separately beat you and uh I'll learn so much about you just seeing how you work out that this is uh like how you deal with like you know adversity like you know how you're how are you as a hang you know do you work out like all these things it's a great tell all right I got two little hacks the first is a principle that I've had for a long time it's called don't attend the party host the party this is my um I have a rule I don't attend other people's events typically unless it's a real good friend who really wants me to but I will host so um I think hosting is it is let's say five times the work but I think it's 500 times the payoff uh when you actually host the the event so we uh Camp MFM is a perfect example of this uh and when you host it um the other the other hack in this is make it epic because it's going to be more fun for you to it's like all the logistical work is kind of the same but if you just use your creativity to make it a more interesting people will come and they'll have like a whole memory to you know a whole experience uh with you so with Camp MFM the way we did it where we flew to this place we had the basketball trainer Mr Beast and Hassan were there like interesting people were there we all stayed in you know an Airbnb a giant house together like that was a instead of just doing a networking event we made it fun and we made it different and I think I know you get a bunch of benefits of being the one who hosted it that's the first one the second one I would say the actual relationship hack with with my wife is so I'm a pretty chill dude but I do I do have one Achilles heel which is I'm very very very impatient and what that means is like you know my wife is like slow to leave the house trying to go somewhere it's like oh dude why does this take so I feel like I've wasted half my life waiting to leave the house um you know just with kids it gets like really slow so I've always had this impatience thing and I've tried to be like all right I'm gonna be more patient I'm gonna be more patient and I realized that that was actually a Fool's errand that the way to be more patient for me is to get in a fight in the morning and what I started doing was I hired this MMA trainer and I would wake up early I do my workout in the morning and I would Spar and what I found is that if I Spar in the morning I've gotten a really hard strenuous like endorphin kick you know done the rest of the day I'm just sort of like yo it's whatever like I I can wait yeah you can take take an extra 10 minutes uh you want to change your shirt because maybe this one's a little maybe a little too hot it's like go ahead go change your shirt yeah no problem I'll be here at the front door chilling and I have become such a more patient person just by doing a sparring session in the morning it's a pretty extreme step to take but it is so far the only thing that has gotten me to change this like really terrible personality trait after so long nothing like getting punched in the face I was I I think I told you that you did tell me that and the other experience I had like this was I've been skydiving once in the morning and the rest of the day you could stress me out if you tried I was in I was a completely immune to stress and so I think there's something to this like having a very exhilarating or adrenaline kick in the morning it just makes the rest of the day completely non-stressful that doesn't mean you don't do anything it just means you don't stress we were talking about the cold plunges and um I was just listening to a huberman lab and he was talking about this exact thing so when you're in cold it obviously stresses your body you get a huge dopamine Spike and you get adrenaline norepinephrine all that kind of stuff and he was saying that if you do stressful things while you're in the cold plunge it adapts you to dealing with stress better so you should definitely get a cold plunge and then argue with your wife while you're in it or something sounds smart uh so that's best religion pack what's the what was the other one you said uh oh favorite tool or product under what it's favorite uh tool or product under a thousand dollars what you guys got so I always have this problem um I'll travel to a city and I'll try and think of you know I'll be like okay I'm going to New York on this day who do I know in New York and it'll be whoever's top of Mind whoever I've just been texting with or something and I'll go and I'll have a couple meetings and then I'll leave and then I'll remember you know it's like when you leave the grocery store and you realize there's like three or four important things you forgot I always realize oh [ __ ] I forgot to meet all these people I really wanted to see and so um I've tried a couple different tools for this but I found one I really liked it's this one called clay it's a personal CRM which we all hate I know it's like a horrible business but um they do a really good job of basically tapping into your Twitter your LinkedIn your iMessage all the pla your email all the places where you contact me and this is uh Earth clay.earth yeah and so basically it's a huge database of all the people you know and so what I do now is I go in clay and I'll just be like I'll type in New York and it'll show me everyone in New York and then I don't miss people uh and that's been huge this is a beautiful website yeah I turn right away because it helps us like uh same problem with all crms for me where like you get out what you put in and I'm just not willing to put it put it enough but there's no I don't use it like I don't you I don't update it it's just when I go traveling it's just a database of people I know and where they live can I uh mine is my body tutor and I don't know if Sean that if that's yours as well but have you heard about my body tutor Andrew no very simple all right here's what it is I spent 600 a month and every day my coach her name's Heather calls me and says what are you gonna eat today and I tell her and she's those yesterday according to your MyFitnessPal you ate this this and this this thing was bad how'd that make you feel and I say I feel horrible I'm not going to do it again today and she just shames me or educates me on why I made a good or bad decision and we like work backwards from whichever goal I want it's it's a five minute phone call uh that's been the bit the best tool I've ever used that's a good one that's all it is I um so I'm a pretty disorganized guy so my favorite tools or products have been the one that helped me get organized and I got two that kind of save my ass this year um I don't know Sam did you when you were at the hustle did you ever have like a bookkeeper yes and do you remember life before a bookkeeper and a life after bookkeeper before it's stressful and like now I know that like I didn't know what the difference between revenue and cash flow was and I didn't like understand like that like you take expenses and you like I'm amortize them I didn't understand all that stuff so it was as if I was driving at night time without headlights on the perfect way to describe it that's how I've been my whole life and I would always wonder man how do these other people have their [ __ ] together how is it you know tax season comes around I'm just like scrambling and it's like the worst version of cramming for a test and so this year I basically totally revamp my financial like hygiene game with a bookkeeper and a tax person that I love and I'm gonna shout them both out because they're amazing uh they were they were so amazing I did invest in both of the companies because I was like I have to like you know I I believe in this uh you know because they saved my ass so one is called Kick so I think it's kick.co is the URL and it's basically if you go to the website I like their tagline it says self-driving bookkeeping so basically what they do is they just say connect your bank your credit cards and it's like everything it's like your Amazon you just click connect connect connect boom it's all your books and then they have bookkeeper and she calls me and she's like here's how you're doing like here's how you're pacing here's what you know here's some things you should be thinking about here's how we can save you money um you know blah blah blah and not like not like spend less but more like tax wise like here's some things that you could do and so bookkeeping was the first one uh and then how much is this all my books are together it's super cheap it's like I don't know it's like 99 or 100 199 a month or something like that it's like if anybody if you're a Creator like the one big thing is they they do this for like kind of like small small businesses like sort of like LLC types s Corps or um creators so like if you're a YouTuber or twitch Creator or a podcaster uh most of them have don't treat their creator business like a business and you totally should it is a business and I think also the law has now changed so starting next year I think they have to do like the quarterly estimated taxes and things like that like dude 99 of the creators have no idea what this stuff is or how to do it and so um so I love this thing this has been like kind of a game changer for me out of having my my p l my cash flow my balance sheet all of it just like very clean and then then that gets handed to the other service gelt and so but guilt does is kind of amazing I don't know how much of this I'm supposed to say are allowed to say it I don't even think they want me shouting it out because it's like dude I just signed it I just signed up I just signed up with gel uh are you on the waitlist are you you actually started using it I dm'd him and I have a call set up so the guy tal is this incredible guy he's an entrepreneur so but for the best thing so I've I've met many I've had many like kind of accountants and Tech strategy people and I literally walked in and I felt like I was walking into a meeting like you know with CIA or something like that with IRS it's like and and Nick Hoover said this right he goes yeah dude 95 of accountants and tax strategy people they're like they act like government agents and he's like you can't even he's like you're just asking questions like how should I structure this differently in order to and they can't answer it's like they're not creative first of all so they're not even giving you ideas it's like if you have the idea they can say yes or no but it's like dude where am I supposed to come up with all these ideas from uh so like they don't give you ideas first of all and secondly they're like well did you spend more than 22 hours doing this it's like dude I don't know I wasn't keeping track of that but like if I say yes what happens if I say no what happens I need to understand like could you just disarm this it's not even like help me cheat it's like literally just don't make this stressful it's been my big problem with this and so guilt is kind of amazing because towels he's a Founder he's an entrepreneur he sold his last company and he's like dude I just like he's like personally I just hated taxes and so I decided to create like the tax firm I wish existed and they're amazing so the same thing they take your books and then what they do is they're more like yo have you thought about structuring your corporations in this way because then you can get the advantage of qsbs while still maintaining this advantage and like they they do everything clean they do everything by the book but they are they feel more like your friend helping you do this than the other way and so these guys probably save me I don't know I don't know how much to save me but I wouldn't be surprised if it was seven figures of what I've saved using this thing um and it's the first time I've been not stressed on the subject of finding like bookkeeping and taxes and so like that has been like a very nice feeling for me to have versus like this scramble and always feeling like there was some adult class that I missed I slept through and now here's the test like that's how that's how taxes always felt for me was I slept through the class and everybody else took it everybody else is prepared and I don't know what the [ __ ] I'm doing and now finally I feel like okay I I have my notes to take this test dude I think it's one of the one of those things that's shocking how many business people just don't know how to read a balance sheet and a p l and cash flow statement and it's if you want to learn Khan Academy has an amazing introductory course takes about an hour and you'll learn everything you need to do you guys hear this the IRS hired like some like some absurd number of new Auditors was it like 18 000 if you're like 80 000 or or more I don't know like IRS hiring new agents I think they hired 80 000 um 87 000 new hires and so I think there's gonna be a [ __ ] little audit which is why I wanted to be like super buttoned up with everything um just because oh man that's another time suck if you get audited of like dealing with all that crap so uh you know I don't think they hire these people to do nothing it's 80 billion 80 billion in new funding and 87 000 tax agents isn't that insane that's [ __ ] crazy they're gonna have a lot of work to cut out for them um I think we should almost wrap up we have we want to do one one or two yeah let's do one or two more what are your favorite ones yeah let's do let's do one what's a really good one what about biggest change adjustment you're making yeah I have one go Sam so um for I have a new thing that I'll launch that it's live but I'll announce it later um I'm hiring a CEO for it I've already like done that and I've never done that early on I also am doing close to like I'm being less of a dictator and I'm also being less metrics driven this sounds like the freaking douchiest thing ever but I'll say it but more like Vibe and energy driven uh basically with the hustle and like my last company I was like by the book where it was like all right I want to see projections we're going to nail it we're gonna like the metrics say this therefore like I can see you putting a metric on the vibe too like we're in 87 on five this week guys well like on my last like for all my companies I'm like look you've got to do this many outbound calls like we're gonna like whatever the a b metric is this is what it is uh like we're going with a that A1 and I just filed the data and I was like I don't care and then it was very much a dictatorship where I said my rule or my way or the highway and I'm trying to be a little bit calmer for my next thing and I think I'll make way more money that way that's a great one great adjustment uh Andrew what you got biggest change or adjustment you're making in your business life 2023 so last year I don't know if I said this but my big goal was conquering email like I just I was overwhelmed by it it was stressing me out and so now I've built a system I've fully delegated it I've got someone dedicated to managing my email and so I really only get 10 or 15 emails that I have to respond to and everything else is triaged and responded to and dealt with so I've conquered email the problem is now I get a lot of iMessages like texts and stuff and I'm going I don't know how to conquer that other than changing my number which seems [ __ ] up um I'm trying to figure that out if anyone has any ideas please tweet at me because um there's it seems like there's no way if someone has your number they're going to get to you and I have a really hard time not responding to text I feel kind of guilty um so I'd love to hear you're just getting like cold texts from strangers is that the problem dude I get so many of those not that it's just there's I mean I get cold text for sure but it's more just like there's so many people I've given my number out to and if someone doesn't get an email response to me sometimes they'll try and go there I think like some people have found my number online like it's just it's just becoming too much and I'll be like with email you can kind of turn it off I'll be putting my kids down for bed and like reading a Kindle book on my phone and I'll be getting hit up with text and it's just the ability to break into your Consciousness would you just get a new number sucks yeah I was thinking about it but I've had my number since I was like 15. it feels messed up to do I know but I've thought about doing that as well Sam uh okay so you did yours Andrew you did yours my biggest adjustment um you knowing when to use my impulsiveness so I am an extremely impulsive person um and that works in like eight out of ten situations one of the situations it doesn't work in is I'm very impulsive with picking businesses to start and yeah I will just like start a business like instantaneously and I will go and I'll start making it happen and it's really fun and that wave and that Thrill is so addictive and then 11 months later I'm like okay now I have this business um was this the business that I wanted to have was because like I can't do that many of these at the same time uh so is this the right are you happy you started your Ecom thing um no if I could go back and just pick a different project I would um same thing with the milk Road part of the reason I sold it was I was like I don't think this was the project that I want to work on every year um you know for the next three years and so if I don't want to work on it for the next three years I should just sell it now and like you know uh if I have a good offer like take it um but that's kind of a shitty feeling like there's a celebration in selling but there's also a bit of a failure it's like I've been saying this for a while I want to work on a project that I don't want to sell like this podcast time has flown by where this is the third year we're doing the Millie awards that means this Friday is at least three years old um I can keep going I would do this for free I was doing this for free I was going to do this at a loss so this is the right type of project for me to do it's one that I would literally do if there was no money involved I don't count the days or the hours I'm not stressed about the metrics I know it's going to keep going up because we'll just keep trying to do a better and better job I have fun doing it and it's not a not a drag on my lifestyle right like perfect project this has been the only project I've selected correctly on I would argue every single business I've started since the age of 21 was the wrong pick and it was always just the impulsive pick it was someone should do this dude I bet I could do that dude I would just do this as this all right let me just do it and I would just do it and then you know sure enough I'm look looking for the exit later because it wasn't really the right project so I'm trying to find the big changes I'm going to find the project that's in my zone of Genius um that is the perfect project for me it's what I enjoy doing um and I'm not building it for some future payoff I'm building it I'm doing it because I like doing it that it is the the project that's you know I'm most interested in and if that changes later okay that's fine I'm not saying I have to do it till I'm 99 years old but um I'm not doing it just kind of like on a whim so I'm going to be patient and select the project properly that's good it's about time I've been telling you that for 10 years the best lessons are the ones that you have to relearn 10 10 times over okay so the other one was best business idea yeah do you guys dude yeah let's end up tell me why your washer and your dryer are two different machines remember to put my wet clothes into the dryer it's ridiculous this needs to be one that's honestly that is one of the smartest actually a really good point it's it's crazy to me it's crazy to me that it's two different things that that actually exists no it's in it's in Best Buy Home Depot they're not that great it's a thing they're not that great yet like I use them in Europe and they're only okay but they need to be the norm this needs to be the norm yeah yeah if you're working on AI or crypto or self-driving cars quit and figure this one out like we gotta put we gotta have our priorities in order you know how many people are wasting time dude like it's like look at James Dyson look at James Dyson he's worth 18 billion dollars and he just was like vacuums are terrible I'm gonna rethink those I mean he could have been working on AI but no you chose something prior machine next to our dishwasher machine thank you I agree dude like some of the or like uh or like have you ever noticed how the inside of a refrigerator no matter how rich you are it always looks like [ __ ] like we need like a better organizer or something for like so some of these like day-to-day problems I think need to be improved particularly we'll start with the washer and dryer it needs to be one machine okay I like that one Andrew um so mine I tweeted about this um so there's all these private jets out there flying around all over the world and uh tell me about it um people people will people will fly somewhere and they don't need a return flight or they're gonna go there for two weeks or three weeks or whatever and so the plane actually flies back empty just with the pilots on it right and I think this is truly insane this is like billions of dollars getting lit on fire every month of just jet fuel and empty planes and stuff I don't know what the solution is I know there's people that have tried this um but it seems like a incredibly inefficient disjointed uh world and someone needs to crack this and create a central database of basically every plane that's available because let's think about who owns private jets it's very very rich people very rich people are usually business people and are logical do they care about having someone else fly back if it pays for all the fuel and stuff probably not maybe like Gucci where it's like well I don't want to like sell my unsold Gucci clothes I'd rather just burn them to keep the value up sure yeah I don't know maybe but anyway I do think there's a lot of people who would certainly uh want to get compensated for that if it was easy and I think someone needs to crack this yeah that's a that's a good one um okay I'm gonna go with the school for the starving artist okay so I've met a lot of people in life who like to do different artsy things you know photography film uh you know met somebody who was like you know they like they're like oh yeah I fell in love with photography because I would hang up the freaking prints and like let them dry like whatever you know whatever that [ __ ] is uh you know coloring you know blah blah drawing there's all these aren't artistic things and I would say most people give up on those passions or things because it's really really hard to make a living doing it or is it that's what I want to answer because now that I'm doing this Ecom thing I now pay a lot of money to photographers it's just that they had to be branded as photographers who understand how to do product photography or commercial photo shoots um my wife when she was in business school was just doodling on her paper board and somebody walked by and luckily they saw that and they go did you draw that and she was like oh yeah sorry uh I'm paying attention I promise he's like no no I don't care like but if you can draw that I have a job for you it's called graphic facilitation you can make a thousand dollars a day just by going to these meetings and conferences for these businesses and you draw on a giant whiteboard what they're talking about so they have a visual takeaway at the end of it and she made more money than me for a long time doing this thing she would have never known how to turn her art into money and so I think somebody should create an art school for people who have artistic talents but want to be rich uh for have our discounts but they want to make a living doing it and not just be a starving artist for their whole life I think you should create a specific school for this and all the courses are things where you take an artistic trait but you teach them how to do it in the commercial way and they can make money even while they're in school doing this like you know how big of a shortage there is of video editors now that YouTube and Tick Tock are so huge or you know again commercial photography or drawing or all these different different uh artistic things so I think somebody should create the school for The Starving Artists where they're no they're not going to starve anymore and uh get the get the artists that are willing to sell out like 25 and just like do this like you see this girl on Tick Tock she does these she'll take like a uh like Dr Pepper will pay her like a million dollars to this Tick Tock where she does these like crazy slo-mo zoom in water dripping on the side and she makes this epic like like video trailer of a Dr Pepper she makes a Dr Pepper look like it's the unveiling of a new you know rocket by SpaceX and she's just really talented at that and brands are willing to pay her for that type of marketing yeah there's a lot of people out there who could do that they just didn't connect the dots well what are you gonna call it you gotta have some cute ass names don't have it yet that's the only whole that's the only hold up I'm not gonna I'm not gonna start until I have the perfect name you know me do we uh Andrew you look like you just got your first communion uh you just like you you have you haven't an Angelic face and an Angelic look it doesn't matter how rich and successful you become you uh you still look like this little perfect communion boy thank you I'm working on becoming a Twilight vampire like uh Brian that's my other goal this year what's the thing he eats every morning the piggy pudding or whatever yeah nutty pudding that's your face looks more trim oh thank you I feel like you say that every time I come on just like a crazy tan have you just ever come back like in Puerto Rican um my problem is I I tan really really well on my arms and face but I'm like I cannot Tan on my body so I have a have you ever done a favor have you tried taking off your shirt uh no this is yeah sure I should do that yeah and I want you to look like you know Ricky Martin so you know just like you need to come back at least like a third Colombian in your tan next year next time okay here's here's the deal here's the deal okay you and I'm serious you get to uh eight percent body fat I will go to a tanning salon I will go in one of those stand-up Tanners and I will uh I will get really tanned and come on you got a deal okay well no no it's crazy 12 12 is like 12 is like soft ABS I want like crazy shreds he'll look shredded because he's dark for like 12 minutes I'm gonna have to like sacrifice my life to do this I think 12 is a more than fair deal okay this is a deal what's the what's the timeline within the year whenever I do it this is a lifelong bet if I ever get there if I ever send you a picture Sam we should we got to talk about that Meetup we're doing in Vancouver I will we'll do a shout out next time at the beginning but we'll also do it
